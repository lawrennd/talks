  We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent
  variable. Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn
  from a distribution, .g. probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This
  simplification is often extended for temporal data where tractable
  Markovian independence assumptions are used (.g. Kalman filters or
  hidden Markov models).\
  {In this talk we will consider the more general case where the latent
  variable is a forcing function in a differential equation model. We will
  show how for some simple ordinary differential equations the latent
  variable can be dealt with analytically for particular Gaussian process
  priors over the latent force. In this talk we will introduce the general
  framework, present results in systems biology and preview extensions.\
