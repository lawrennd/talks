### Utility Theory and Utilitarianism

* Utilitarianism maps to *utility theory*

* Assume that result of a decision can be evaluated mathematically.

### Utility Theory

* An approach to balancing sensitivity vs specificity in a decision.

* Decision theory

### Basics

* define a *utility function*

### The Push and the Trolley

### Evolution and Utilitarianism

* Bentham was not aware of Darwin's principle of natural selection

* Bentham believed that we should take an action if it maximised the happiness of the population (thereby minimising pain). 

* His utility function was the sum of the happiness of the population. 


### John Stuart Mill

* Struggled with the idea that a night of debauchery was the same form of happiness.

* See also Epicurius

### Natural Selection

* Species evolve through natural selection

* Bentham's idea was that we should maximize happiness. 

* In reality happiness is some form of *intermediate* reward.

### Mathematics of Change

* Driven by Newton and [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz)'s work differential calculus. 

* Actually happiness is some (monotonic) function of the gradient of whatever personal utility function we have. 

* John Stuart Mill's variation on utilitarianism considered 'higher pleasures', such as the pleasure gained from literature and learning. (See also Eleni Vasilaki on Epicurus @Vasilaki-epicurius17)

* our happiness must be integrated to form our utility. 

### Prospect Theory


* Daniel Kahneman's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded for the idea of *prospect theory*. 

* Kahneman describes the theory and its background in his book, "Thinking Fast and Slow" [@Kahneman-fastslow11]. 

* Empirical theory about how people are responsive to change in circumstance, not absolute circumstance. 

### Subjective Utility

* Bentham's ideas focussed around the idea of a global utility.

* Natural selection insists there must be *variation* in the population

* Without variation, there is no separation between effective and ineffective strategies.

### A Cognitive Bias towards Variance

* Kahneman explores our tendency to produce overcomplicated explanations

* Prediction is
    $$ \text{model} + \text{data} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$

* Models fail as overly simple or overly complex


### Bias vs Variance


* 'bias variance dilemma' @Geman-biasvariance92

* Decompose errors as 
    1. due to oversimplification (the bias error) and 
	2. those due to insufficient data to underpin a complex model (variance error).

### In Machine Learning

* Two approaches
   * Use simpler models (better consistency and generalization)
   * Use more complex models and average.



### Decision Making and Bias-Variance

* In a population we should prefer variance-errors. 
    * Bias errors lead to consistent, decsion making.
	* Consistently wrong!
	
* Variance errors can also be averaged e.g. [bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) and [boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)) [@Breiman-bagging96] 



### Rational Behaviour

* Sustain a variety of approaches to life.

* Complex explanations such as half-time football punditry.

* Also clinical experts [@Meehl-clinicalstatistical54]. Meehl suggested they 'try to be clever and think outside the box'. 

### One Correct Solution

* Artificial Selection and Eugenics.

* OK for race horses, greyhounds, crops, sheep and cows 

* Not OK for the human race.

### One Correct Solution

* Flawed understanding of science

* Animals in a species become too specialised then they may not be able to respond to changing circumstances. 
    * Think of cheetahs and eagles vs rats and pigeons.

### Similar Ideas Socially

> I may not agree with many people's subjective approach to life, I may even believe it to be severely sub-optimal. But I should not presume to know better, even if prior experience shows that my own 'way of being' is effective. 
>
> Variation is vitally important for robustness. There may be future circumstances where my approaches fail utterly, and other ways of being are better.

### A Universal Utility

* Quality of our individual subjective utilities measured by effectiveness.

* But it is surival of entire species that dominates long term.

* A universal utility by which we are judged is difficult to define.

### The Real Ethical Dilemma

* Trolley Problem is an oversimplification.

* Driverless cars: 
    * introduce driverless cars and bring about a 90% reduction in deaths 
	* What if remaining deaths are all cyclists?
	
### Uncertainty: The Tyger that Burns Bright

* Non-survival of the non-fit 

* The marvel of evolution is its responsiveness.

* Utility function evolves socially and in our environment.


(["survival of the fittest"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) is due to [Herbert Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer))

### Absolute Policies

* There is only one absolute policy we should follow. 

> There will be single absolute policy that should be followed slavishly in all circumstances

### Tigers and Trolleys

* Second trolley example takes on a new light. 

* The first example, that of a simple switch in the points, is deterministic/mechanistic

* The second example is largely contrived, and riddled with uncertainty.

### George Box


> Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad.
>
> George E. P. Box [@Box-science76]


### Conclusion

* Uncertainty of the correct utility implies  'correct' decision is difficult produce or verify. 

* Tendency to seek proxies such as *consistency* in decision making. 

* Consistent algorithms oversimplifies.

* Society would be more robust if diversity of solutions and opinions are sustained and respected.
