title: Life, the Universe and Machine Learning
abstract: "What is Machine Learning? Why is it useful for us? Machine learning algorithms
  are the engines that are driving forward an intelligent internet. They are allowing
  us to uncover the causes of cancer and helping us understand the way the universe
  is put together. They are suggesting who your friends are on facebook, enabling
  driverless cars and causing flagging potentially fraudulent transactions on your
  credit card. To put it simply, machine learning is about understanding data. 
  
  <p>In this lecture I will try and give a sense of the challenges we face in machine learning,
  with a particular focus on those that have inspired my research. We will look at
  applications of data modelling from the early 18th century to the present, and see
  how they relate to modern machine learning. There will be a particular focus on
  dealing with <i>uncertainty</i>: something humans are good at, but an
  area where computers have typically struggled. We will emphasize the role of uncertainty
  in data modelling and hope to persuade the audience that correct handling of uncertainty
  may be one of the keys to intelligent systems."
