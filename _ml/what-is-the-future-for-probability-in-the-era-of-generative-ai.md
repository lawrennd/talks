title: "What is the Future for Probability in the Era of Generative AI?"
abstract: |
  In this talk I will speculate on what the current generation of generative AI technologies means for those of us who have been building probabilistic models in machine learning. In particular, I'll explore what these models mean at the human computer interface, suggesting that the generative AI models allow for a new type of computer a "human-analagous machine" (HAM) which constructs a feature space that is analagouse the equivalent "feature space" we use in our head for human reasoning. This allows for these machines to be much more robust to the types of ambiguity typically expressed by humans and to present the most salient information to humans about the status of a machine system. However, it also allows for what Daniel Dennet has referred to as "counterfeit humans". This presents new opportunities for those in probabilistic modelling to understand what it means for a human to gain a calibrated understanding of uncertainty through interacting with a HAM.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\notes{The probabilistic modelling community has evolved in an era where the assumption was that ambiguous conclusions are best shared with a (trained) professional through probabilities. Recent advances in generative AI offer the possibility of machines that have a better understanding of human subjective ambiguities and therefore machines that can summarise information in a way that can be interogated rather than just through a series of numbers.}

\slides{* HAMs change how we share ambiguous information.
* We need to think about how that effects our sharing of proabilities.}
