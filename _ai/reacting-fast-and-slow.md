title: "Reacting, Fast and Slow"
abstract: |
  What is fundamental to our intelligence? In this talk building on the ideas in *The Atomic Human* I argue that the external world is key to our intelligence, and how that world is filtered before we perceive it. This leads to the Eisenhower illusion, where we feel ourselves in charge but we are in fact reliant on fast reacting systems.
