title: Bayesian Processing of cDNA Microarray Images
abstract: Gene expression levels are obtained from microarray experiments through
  the extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image of the slide. It is widely
  acknowledged that variabilities can occur in expression levels extracted from the
  same images by different users with the same software packages. These inconsistencies
  arise due to differences in the refinement of the placement of the microarray ‘grids’.
  We introduce a novel automated approach to the refinement of grid placements that
  is based upon the use of Bayesian inference for determining the size, shape and
  positioning of the microarray ‘spots’, capturing uncertainty that can be passed
  to downstream analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that variability between users
  can be significantly reduced using the approach. The automated nature of the approach
  also saves hours of researchers’ time normally spent in refining the grid placement.
  A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is available for non-commercial use from
