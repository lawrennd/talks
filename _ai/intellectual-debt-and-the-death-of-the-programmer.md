title: "Intellectual Debt and the Death of the Programmer"
abstract: >
  Technical debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought as to how they will be *maintained*. Intellectual debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought to how they'll be *explained*.
  
  Both problems are pervasive in the design and deployment of large scale algorithmic decision making engines. 
  
  In this talk we'll review the origin of the problem, and propose a roadmap for obtaining solutions. It's a journey that will require collaboration between industry, academia, third sector, and government.
