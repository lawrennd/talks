<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is
not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across
society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

Large Language Model, An oracle, a sorcerer, a wordsmith, yea verily, a

<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own
hand, To mimic our thoughts, our voice, our very essence.</p>
<p>A thousand minds, nay, a millionfold, Conjoined in this digital
Athenaeum, Words and phrases, like soldiers in battle, Marching to form
the verses of our age.</p>
<p>This Large Language Model, a changeling so fair, Hath the power to
bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this
digital bard, And mayhaps, by its grace, we shall glean some wisdom, As
we wander together, hand in hand, Through this boundless realm of
knowledge and wonder.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<p>Figure: <a

Open Society and Its Enemies by Karl Popper</a> views liberal
democracies as a collection of “piecemeal social engineers” who strive
towards better outcomes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Popper opened the preface to his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="Popper-open45">(<strong>Popper-open45?</strong>)</span> with
the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to
belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to
great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to
show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial
attack on freedom and reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had written the book against the background of the second world
war, his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria
in March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For Popper, the ideas of “great men” become totalitarian when imposed
on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form
of government that can allow for institutional change without bloodshed.
The open society is one characterized by institutions and individuals
that can engage in the practical pursuit of solutions to social and
political problems. The institutions are also underpinned by
individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil administrators and many more.
To Popper it is these “piecemeal social engineers” who offer pragmatic
solutions to our society’s political and social challenges.</p>

<p>Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology
design.</p>
<p>Building this pipeline requires coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.</p>

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in
practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of
considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of
opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality
of community is related to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called
procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em>
form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in
sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced.
It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals
may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in
tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable.
It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be
obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily
undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding
of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals
in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing
and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of
dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the
two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the
decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair
distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an
objectively correct balance between the two for any given context.
Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal
values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that
are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension
in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained
professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response
to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of
their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but
also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while
humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have
an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the
human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning, but
need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field machine
learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle some complex,
‘real world’ problems.</p>
<p>It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has started
the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new Programme is
seeking to support researchers across the University to develop the
skills they need to be able to use machine learning and AI in their
research.</p>
<p>To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops and
applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific challenges,
with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on issues
relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While
we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for now, in the longer term our
ambition is to build links with the social sciences and humanities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recruited a core research team working on the application of AI
in mental health, bioinformatics, healthcare, string theory, and complex
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Created a research agenda and roadmap for the development of AI
in science.</p></li>
<li><p>Funded 9 interdisciplinary projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Antimicrobial resistance in farming</p></li>
<li><p>Quantifying Design Trade-offs in Electricity-generation-focused
Tokamaks using AI</p></li>
<li><p>Automated preclinical drug discovery in vivo using pose
estimation</p></li>
<li><p>Causal Methods for Environmental Science Workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic tree mapping in Cambridge</p></li>
<li><p>Acoustic monitoring for biodiversity conservation</p></li>
<li><p>AI, mathematics and string theory</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretical, Scientific, and Philosophical Perspectives on
Biological Understanding in the age of Artificial Intelligence</p></li>
<li><p>AI in pathology: optimising a classifier for digital images of
duodenal biopsies</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a pipeline
of learning opportunities to help PhD students and postdocs better
understand how to use data science and machine learning in their
work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<p>Teaching and learning</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brought over 250 participants from over 30 departments through
tailored data science and machine learning for science training (Data
Science Residency and Machine Learning Academy);</p></li>
<li><p>Convened workshops with over 80 researchers across the University
on the development of data pipelines for science;</p></li>
<li><p>Delivered University courses to over 100 students in Advanced
Data Science and Machine Learning and the Physical World.</p></li>
<li><p>Online training course in Python and Pandas accessed by over 380
researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on machine
learning and the sciences, helping to share best practice and new
methods, and support each other in advancing their research. Over the
coming years, we’ll be running a variety of events and activities in
support of this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Launched a Machine Learning Engineering Clinic that has supported
over 40 projects across the University with MLE troubleshooting and
advice;</p></li>
<li><p>Hosted and participated in events reaching over 300 people in
Cambridge;</p></li>
<li><p>Led international workshops at Dagstuhl and Oberwolfach,
convening over 60 leading researchers;</p></li>
<li><p>Engaged over 70 researchers through outreach sessions and
workshops with the School of Clinical Medicine, the Faculty of
Education, Cambridge Digital Humanities and the School of Biological
Sciences.</p></li>

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated
decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data
there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but
also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for
targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to
identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual
selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The feudal system that is implied by current data protection
legislation has significant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the
data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data
subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too
late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often
their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but
that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>

Data Trusts</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Edwards:privacy04 Lawrence:trusts16 Delacroix:trusts18">(Delacroix
and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a
potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em>
that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to
the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organization
where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees’
responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the
motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the
data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under
which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would
be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of
individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the
Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded
with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily
involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems
clear that we need to better characterize the data sharing landscape as
well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data
sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it
feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be
taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider
negotiations.</p>
