    "In this note book we deal with reviewer calibration. Our assumption is\n",
    "that the score from the $j$th reviwer for the $i$th paper is given by $$\n",
    "y_{i,j} = f_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{i, j}\n",
    "$$ where $f_i$ is the ‘objective quality’ of paper $i$ and $b_j$ is an\n",
    "offset associated with reviewer $j$. $\\epsilon_{i,j}$ is a subjective\n",
    "quality estimate which reflects how a specific reviewer’s opinion\n",
    "differs from other reviewers (such differences in opinion may be due to\n",
    "differing expertise or perspective). The underlying ‘objective quality’\n",
    "of the paper is assumed to be the same for all reviewers and the\n",
    "reviewer offset is assumed to be the same for all papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have $n$ papers and $m$ reviewers then this implies $n$ + $m$ +\n",
    "$nm$ values need to be estimated. Naturally this is too many, and we can\n",
    "start by assuming that the subjective quality is drawn from a normal\n",
    "density with variance $\\sigma^2$ $$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{i, j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\n",
    "$$ which reduces us to $n$ + $m$ + 1 parameters. Further we can assume\n",
    "that the objective quality is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu$\n",
    "and variance $\\alpha_f$, $$\n",
    "f_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\alpha_f)\n",
    "$$ this now reduces us to $m$+3 parameters. However, we only have\n",
    "approximately $4m$ observations (4 papers per reviewer) so parameters\n",
    "may still not be that well determined (particularly for those reviewers\n",
    "that have only one review). We therefore, finally, assume that reviewer\n",
    "offset is normally distributed with zero mean, $$\n",
    "b_j \\sim N(0, \\alpha_b),\n",
    "$$ leaving us only four parameters: $\\mu$, $\\sigma^2$, $\\alpha_f$ and\n",
    "$\\alpha_b$. Combined together these three assumptions imply that $$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu \\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{K})\n",

    "$$ where $i$ and $j$ are the index of first paper and reviewer and $k$\n",
    "and $l$ are the index of second paper and reviewer. The mean is easily\n",
    "estimated by maximum likelihood, and is given as the mean of all scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is convenient to reparameterize slightly into an overall scale\n",
    "$\\alpha_f$, and normalized variance parameters, $$\n",

    "$$ which we rewrite to give two ratios: offset/signal ratio,\n",

    "$\\alpha_f$ directly (with a fixed point equation) and it will be very\n",
    "well determined. This leaves us with two free parameters, that we can\n",
    "explore on the grid. It is in these parameters that we expect the\n",
    "remaining underdetermindness of the model. We expect $\\alpha_f$ to be\n",

    "\\frac{|\\mathbf{y}|}{2}\\log\\alpha_f + \\frac{1}{2}\\log  \\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}\\right| + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha_f}\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$ where $|\\mathbf{y}|$ is the length of $\\mathbf{y}$ (i.e. the number\n",
    "of reviews) and $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\alpha_f^{-1}\\mathbf{K}$ is the scale\n",
    "normalised covariance. This negative log likelihood is easily minimized\n",
    "to recover $$\n",
    "\\alpha_f = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{y}|} \\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$ A Bayesian analysis of this parameter is possible with gamma priors,\n",

    "will be around $|\\mathbf{y}| \\approx 6,000$ in our case.\n",
