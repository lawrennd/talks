abstract: 
  Regression models can be useful in various ways. In this talk we
  will focus on how we can use them to compute causal effects, so we
  can augment our toolkit when reasoning about how the world around us
  works. We will review some basic concepts of causal reasoning and
  revisit some common statistical misconceptions that can easily
  avoided with proper causal thinking.
