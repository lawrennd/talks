title: Information Infrastructure for Health
abstract: In this talk we will address challenges in information infrastructure for
  health. Personalized health care is one of the promises of the information revolution.
  However, there are major challenges in the curation, collection and management of
  the data. These are not currently being properly addressed. The care.data fiasco
  demonstrated the high sensitivity of the public to this data regime. Data leaks
  from the Pentagon, TalkTalk, Carphone Warehouse have demonstrated the inability
  of major institutions to keep our data secure. healthcare data is purportedly worth
  ten times credit card information on international black markets. Machine learning
  techniques are currently part of the problem, not the solution, they require centralised
  assimilation of data in a repository that can be easily accessed. A more robust
  information infrastructure would distribute data and contain afar greater degree
  of patient control over access. Such user-centric models may offer greater opportunity
  in terms of obtaining the necessary data-liquidity to fulfill the full potential
  of personalized health in effecting individualsâ€™ health outcomes.
