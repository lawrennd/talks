title: "Deploying Machine Learning: Intellectual Debt and AutoAI"
abstract: >
  From the dawn of cybernetics, and across the last eight decades, we’ve worked to make machine learning methods successful. But now that these methods are being widely adopted we need to deal with the consequences of success. Many of those consequences can only be understood when a holistic approach to the machine learning problem is considered: the deployment of a method within a context for a particular objective. In this circumstance, it’s easy to see that questions of interpretability, fairness and transparency are all contextual. In this talk we summarize this challenge using Jonathan Zittrain’s term of “intellectual debt”, we discuss how it pans out in reality and how this challenge could be addressed using machine learning techniques to give us “Auto AI”.
