abstract: "There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and big data. We\u2019re
  entering a new era of misrepresentation, but these challenges are not new. Humans
  are easily misled, but some basic skepticism and attention to detail can keep us
  on top of the new challenges we face. In this talk will give some hints and tips
  on how to progress."
