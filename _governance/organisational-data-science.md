title: "Organisational Data Science"
abstract:  >
  In this talk we review the challenges in making an organisation data-driven in its decision making. Building on experience working within Amazon and providing advice through the Royal Society convened DELVE group we review challenges and solutions for improving the data capabilities of an institution. This talk is targeted at data-aware leaders working in an institution.

From CDEI Chair Pitch

What are the Greatest Opportunities for the UK in enabling data-driven innovation?

I like to separate "greenfield" innovation and "brownfield" innovation. Both are important, but are different in character.

Greenfield Innovation: For example, the computer games Industry in the early days of
software. A new form of business and company that capitalises on new technology to create new businesses.

In the 1980s Robert Solow said: I see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics. This is the challenge of brownfield innovation, retrofitting the technology into existing businesses. For example, the process of digital transformation Is still not complete in supply chain (my team at Amazon focussed on delivering machine learning technology in that domain).

Massive opportunity for the UK in brownfield innovation, but it's easier to talk about greenfield innovation (e.g. how Google does things) regardless of whether those ideas transfer. The key challenge/opportunity is bridging the gap. We require an ecosystem of companies that are greenfield innovators that address the challenges of the brownfield domains. We can't afford for there to be such alarge gap between e.g. car parts manufacturing in Rotherham vs city trading.

How can the Centre best help?

National data strategy does agreat job of outlining the landscape. CDEI advocates, but key question is "what levers do we have to pull?". Focussing on government, many levers are not directly accessible by DCMS, Iwas in asimilar position at Amazon. The approach we took was the 'shiny bike model'. Build things that Government, Director Generals and Permanent Secretaries must have, ideas that will Just be taken from us.

Some example ideas.

1. Pathfinder projects
a) Work with Treasury, companies and academics on real time prediction of GDP from payments
b) Or developing transport plans in combination with providers of movement data (mobile phone companies, apple, google),
c) Value: Learn about the challenges involved in data sharing between government, industry and academia and learn the solutions.

2. Data Strategy Champions,
a) Develop the skill set of analysts and decision makers from across civil service. Redeploy these experts back into their departments as 'data strategy champions'
b) Need to be supported by 'shiny bike Ideas' so that they have cover from DGs and Permanent Secs.

3. Data Maturity Assessments
a) Surveys' of data capabilities across government departments that could be reused
within industry to understand where needs are. 4. "Highway code for data"
 a) Guidance for those who are occupying the 'digital highway' on what the standards of behaviour are. Aroute to developing legislation that Is tied to everyday practices,
b) This feels key for translating high level discussions about ethics into practical realities (conceptionally moving from 'trolley problems' to 'green cross codes'),
c) This could also lead to legislation for data sharing Institutions (e.g. data trusts) 5. Advise department on plans
a) Review 2020 CSR and see how data enabled policy is helping or could have helped,
b) Provide support for developing plans for 2021 CSR and advising on implementation.

These projects provide outputs as technical innovations. They should be delivered with a philosophy of "Don't reinvent the wheel". Work in close partnership with stakeholders as well as ICO, ONS, HDR, ODI, Al Council, Ada Lovelace Institute. CDEI should bridge the gaps, taking aholistic view of the data landscape and supporting the rapid deployment of ethical data driven innovation:
