title: Learning and Inference with Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  Many application domains of machine learning can be reduced to inference
  about the values of a function. Gaussian processes are powerful,
  flexible, probabilistic models that enable us to efficiently perform
  inference about functions in the presence of uncertainty. In this talk I
  will introduce Gaussian processes and review a few standard applications
  of these models. I will then show how Gaussian processes can be used to
  solve important and diverse real-world problems, including inference of
  the concentration of transcription factors which regulate gene
  expression and creating probabilistic models of human motion for
  animation and tracking.
