title: "What Makes Us Unique in the Age of AI"
abstract: |
  A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we're having
  about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our identity?
 
  Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
  intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI
  not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the
  implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our
  position at the centre of the world.
 
  Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
  continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components:
  eventually we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek
  for uncuttable is 'atom'). In the same way, by slicing away at the
  facets of human intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI
  uncovers what is left: an indivisible core that is the essence of
  humanity.
 
  By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
  Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and
  limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
  by the experts, but ordinary people. 
 
  The thinking in this talk comes from Neil's forthcoming book to be
  published with Allen Lane in June 2024. The main premise is that AI 
  represents a cogntive revolution akin to the Copernican celestial 
  revolution. But as we realise that we are not at the centre of the
  cognitive universe, we can understand better who we are and what is
  precious about us.

\notes{\section{Conclusion}}

\notes{We are in the midst of a cognitive Corpenican revolution that is as significant as the cosmological Copernican revolution. A combination of observer bias and self-serving bias have caused some to place our intelligence at the centre of the cogntiive universe. In fact our intelligence is a consequence of our context. It reflects our limitations and our vulnerabilities. It is to be treasured not because it has objective primacy over other forms of information processing but because, like our ecology, it is irreplaceable and remarkable for what it is in itself.}
