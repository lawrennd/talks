title: "fAIth"
abstract: "What is artificial intelligence and what are the implications of advances in artificial intelligence for society? In this talk we give a short introduction to the technology that's underpinning advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning. We then develop those ideas with a particular focus on how artificial intelligences differ from *natural* intelligences. Finally, we reflect on what the existence of different intelligences might mean for our experiences as humans."
