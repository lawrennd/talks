\subsection{Conclusions}

\notes{The probabilistic modelling community has evolved in an era where the assumption was that ambiguous conclusions are best shared with a (trained) professional through probabilities. Recent advances in generative AI offer the possibility of machines that have a better understanding of human subjective ambiguities and therefore machines that can summarise information in a way that can be interogated rather than just through a series of numbers.}
