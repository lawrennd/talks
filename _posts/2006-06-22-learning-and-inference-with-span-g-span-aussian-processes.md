title: Learning and Inference with <span>G</span>aussian Processes
abstract: Many application domains of machine learning can be reduced to inference
  about the values of a function. Gaussian processes are powerful, flexible, probabilistic
  models that enable us to efficiently perform inference about functions in the presence
  of uncertainty. In this talk I will introduce Gaussian processes and review a few
  standard applications of these models. I will then show how Gaussian processes can
  be used to solve important and diverse real-world problems, including inference
  of the concentration of transcription factors which regulate gene expression and
  creating probabilistic models of human motion for animation and tracking.
