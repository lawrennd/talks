  Is Python a viable replacement for MATLAB?\
  \
  We are incredibly reliant on MATLAB, but should we be looking elsewhere for our ML programming needs? In this ML lunch I will try and share my recent experiences with Python and machine learning: good and bad. The main questions I think we should be considering are:\
  \
  Should we be trying to move to Python for our research?\
  \
  Should we be using Python in our teaching?\
  \
  I don’t know the answer, but I’ll try and use this MLO lunch to start the debate!
