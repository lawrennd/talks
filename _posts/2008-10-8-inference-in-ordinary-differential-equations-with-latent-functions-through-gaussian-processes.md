  In biochemical interaction networks is a key problem in estimation of
  the structure and parameters of the genetic, metabolic and protein
  interaction networks that underpin all biological processes. We present
  a framework for Bayesian marginalisation of these latent chemical
  species through Gaussian process priors. We demonstrate our general
  approach on three different biological examples of single input motifs,
  including both activation and repression of transcription. We focus in
  particular on the problem of inferring transcription factor activity
  when the concentration of active protein cannot easily be measured. The
  uncertainty in the inferred transcription factor activity can be
  integrated out in order to derive a likelihood function that can be used
  for the estimation of regulatory model parameters.
