title: Probabilistic Dimensional Reduction with the Gaussian Process Latent Variable
  Model
abstract: |
  Density modelling in high dimensions is a very difficult problem.
  Traditional approaches, such as mixtures of Gaussians, typically fail to
  capture the structure of data sets in high dimensional spaces. In this
  talk we will argue that for many data sets of interest, the data can be
  represented as a lower dimensional manifold immersed in the higher
  dimensional space. We will then present the Gaussian Process Latent
  Variable Model (GP-LVM), a non-linear probabilistic variant of principal
  component analysis (PCA) which implicitly assumes that the data lies on
  a lower dimensional space. Having introduced the GP-LVM we will review
  extensions to the algorithm, including dynamics, learning of large data
  sets and back constraints. We will demonstrate the application of the
  model and its extensions to a range of data sets, including human motion
  data, a vowel data set and a robot mapping problem.
