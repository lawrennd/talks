title: "Machine Learning: A Revolution in Computer Science?"
venue: "Cambridge Ring Dinner"
abstract: "Machine learning technologies have underpinned the recent upsurge in interest in artificial intelligence. They introduce decision making driven by data. One facet that seems to have escaped us unnoticed is their transgression of the data/code boundary which has hitherto been sacrosanct in computer science. In this talk I argue that the next wave of development in artificial intelligence technologies will not be through individual machine learning algorithms, but by revisiting how we deliver computer science technologies in the light of this change."

<h1 id="the-great-ai-fallacy">The Great AI Fallacy</h1>
<p>I don’t know what Artificial Intelligence means, but one commonality I see in the use of the term is an idea which I’m coming to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>The next wave of machine learning is a paradigm shift in the way we think about computer science.</p>
<p>Classical computer science assumes that ‘data’ and ‘code’ are separate, and this is the foundation of secure computer systems. In machine learning, ‘data’ is ‘software’, so the decision making is directly influenced by the data. We are short-circuiting a fundamental assumption of computer science, we are breeching the code/data separation.</p>
<p>This means we need to revisit many of our assumptions and tooling around the machine learning process. In particular, we need new approaches to systems design, new approaches to programming languages that highlight the importance of data, and new approaches to systems security.</p>
