title: "Data Science and Digital Systems"
subtitle: "The Three Ds of ML Systems Design"
abstract: >
  Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep
  learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in
  “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines
  and is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with
  machine learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the
  near and far future. These include practical application of existing
  algorithms in the face of the need to explain decision making,
  mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data,
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.

\notes{We operate in a technologically evolving environment.  Machine learning is becoming a key coponent in our decision making capabilities, our intelligence and strategic command. However, technology drove changes in battlefield strategy. From the stalemate of the first world war to the tank-dominated Blitzkrieg of the second, to the asymmetric warfare of the present. Our technology, tactics and strategies are also constantly evolving. Machine learning is part of that evolution solution, but the main challenge is not to become so fixated on the tactics of today that we miss the evolution of strategy that the technology is suggesting.}
