title: Towards Computational Systems Biology with a Statistical Analysis Pipeline
  for Microarray Data
abstract: |
  Since the human genome project began mathematical models have become an
  integral part of biological data analysis. The growth in data
  availability has necessitated their use in summarization of the data
  (e.g. *statistical* approaches such as hierarchical clustering).
  Simultaneously, as more has become understood about the mechanisms
  underpinning particular pathways *mechanistic* models of interactions
  have become more widespread.\
  \
  The data-driven statistical approach and the mechanistic model approach
  each have their advantages. Data-driven models can be used in genome
  wide analyses to ’fish’ for genes that were not known to be relevant but
  provide a critical role in a pathway. Mechanistic models make real
  predictions about how systems will respond given particular
  interventions. The two approaches have interacted only loosely, often
  not through interaction between the ‘mathematicians’ but through
  indirect interaction via the biologists.\
  \
  In this talk we will follow describe a statistical analysis ‘pipeline’
  for microarray data which handles the noise in the data. As we proceed
  down the pipeline we will come closer to mechanistic models of systems.
  We will finish with some general thoughts about the contribution that a
  combined statistical/mechanistic modelling approach can make.
