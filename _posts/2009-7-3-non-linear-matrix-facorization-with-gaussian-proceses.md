:abstract: A popular approach to collaborative filtering is matrix factorization.
  In this talk we consider the ``probabilistic matrix factorization'' and by taking
  a latent variable model perspective we show its equivalence to Bayesian PCA. This
  inspires us to consider probabilistic PCA and its non-linear extension, the Gaussian
  process latent variable model (GP-LVM) as an approach for probabilistic non-linear
  matrix factorization. We apply out approach to benchmark movie recommender data
  sets. The results show better than previous state-of-the-art performance.
