title: 'Computational Perspectives: Fairness and Awareness in the Analysis of Data'
abstract: What is data science? An new name for something old perhaps. Nevertheless
  there is something new happening. Data is being acquired in ways that coudl never
  have been envisaged 100 years ago. This is presenting new challenges, and ones that
  no single field is equipped to face. As well as the need for new methodologies and
  theoretical underpinnings, modern data processing is having a direct effect on our
  citizens in real time. In this talk Iâ€™ll suggest that data science provides a banner
  under which the computational and statistical sciences can unite to provide an unified
  response.
