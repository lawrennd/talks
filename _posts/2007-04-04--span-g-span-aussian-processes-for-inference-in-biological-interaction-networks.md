title: "<span>G</span>aussian Processes for Inference in Biological Interaction Networks"
abstract: In many biological applications key functions of interest, such as chemical
  species concentrations, are unobserved. In this talk we will briefly introduce Gaussian
  processes, which are probabilistic models of functions. We will show how they can
  be used, in combination with a simple differential equation model, to estimate the
  concentration of a transcription factor in a simple single input module network
  motif.
venue: Exploring the Interface Between Mathematics and Bioscience, Manchester Interdisciplinary
  Biocentre, University of Manchester, U.K.
