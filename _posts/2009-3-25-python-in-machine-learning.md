abstract: 'Is Python a viable replacement for MATLAB?\\\{We are incredibly reliant
  on MATLAB, but should we be looking elsewhere for our ML programming needs? In this
  ML lunch I will try and share my recent experiences with Python and machine learning:
  good and bad. The main questions I think we should be considering are:\\\{Should
  we be trying to move to Python for our research?\\\{Should we be using Python in
  our teaching?\\\{I don’t know the answer, but I’ll try and use this MLO lunch to
  start the debate!'
