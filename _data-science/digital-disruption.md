title: "Digital Disruption"
subtitle: "Where We Are Now"
abstract: >
  We look towards the future of digital disruption by considering the past of disruption, with a particular focus on the production and movement of goods. 
  
  We introduce the notion of the 'smith', and consider how, by localizing the provision, or supply, a 'smith' can ensure high added value for their skills.
  
  Using analogies from *pull* and *push* supply chains, We argue that our future economy needs to include an environment where a *smiths* prosper. From craft coffee to craft software, to add value in a global marketplace we argue that we need to exploit localization.

\figure{\includejpg{../slides/diagrams/supply-chain/packhorse-bridge-burbage-brook}{80%}{Packhorse Bridge under Burbage Edge. This packhorse route climbs steeply out of Hathersage and heads towards Sheffield. Packhorses were the main route for transporting goods across the Peak District. The high cost of transport is one driver of the 'smith' model, where there is a local skilled person responsible for assembling or creating goods (e.g. a blacksmith). }

\figure{\includejpg{../slides/diagrams/supply-chain/cromford-mill}{80%}}{Richard Arkwright is regarded of the founder of the modern factory system. Factories exploit distribution networks to centralize production of goods. Arkwright located his factory in Cromford due to proximity to Nottingham Weavers (his market) and availability of water power from the tributaries of the Derwent river. When he first arrived there was almost no transportation network. Over the following 200 years The Cromford Canal (1790s), a Turnpike (now the A6, 1816-18) and the the High Peak Railway (now closed, 1820s) were all constructed to improve transportation access as the factory blossomed.}

\figure{\includejpg{../slides/diagrams/supply-chain/container-2539942_1920}{80%}}{The container is one of the major drivers of globalization. It reduces the cost of transportation, significantly changing the appropriate topology of distribution networks. The container makes it possible to ship goods half way around the world for cheaper than it costs to process those goods, leading to an extended distribution topology.}

\figure{\includejpg{../slides/diagrams/supply-chain/wild-alaskan-cod-made-in-china}{80%}}{The falling cost of international transport means it is cheaper to process the Cod in China, rather than in the US. So wild caught cod sold in the Pacific Northwest becomes a product of China.}
