title: "FIT Machine Learning Systems"
venue: "Huawei-Cambridge Workshop"
abstract: "<p>As machine learning becomes more widely deployed, it is important that we understand what we have deployed. There has been a lot of focus in machine learning research on the fairness and interpretability of individual models, but less attention paid to how this fits into a wider machine learning system. In this talk I’ll motivate the importance of fair, interpretable and transparent machine learning systems. I’ll outline the challenges and highlight some of the directions we are considering to address these challenges. This work is sponsored by an Alan Turing Institute Senior AI Fellowship.</p>"

<h1 id="the-great-ai-fallacy">The Great AI Fallacy</h1>
<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of explanation that come with AI is Intellectual Debt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In computer systems the concept of <em>technical debt</em> has been surfaced by authors including <span class="citation" data-cites="Sculley:debt15">Sculley et al. (2015)</span>. It is an important concept, that I think is somewhat hidden from the academic community, because it is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer software system is deployed.</p>
<h2 id="lean-startup-methodology">Lean Startup Methodology</h2>
<p>In technology, there is the notion of a “minimum viable product” (MVP). Sometimes called “minimum loveable product” (MLP). A minimum viable product is the smallest thing that you need to ship to test your commercial idea. There is a methodology known as the “lean start-up” methodology, where you use the least effort to create your machine learning model is deployed.</p>
<p>The idea is that you should build the quickest thing possible to test your market and see if your idea works. Only when you know your idea is working should you invest more time and personnel in the software.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a tension between deploying quickly and deploying a maintainable system. To build an MVP you deploy quickly, but if the system is successful you take a ‘maintenance hit’ in the future because you’ve not invested early in the right maintainable design for your system.</p>
<p>You save on engineer time at the beginning, but you pay it back with high interest when you need a much higher operations load once the system is deployed.</p>
<p>The notion of the Sculley paper is that there are particular challenges for machine learning models around technical debt.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>However, when managing systems in production, you soon discover maintenance of a rapidly deployed system is not your only problem.</p>
<p>To deploy large and complex software systems, an engineering approach known as “separation of concerns” is taken. Frederick Brooks’ book “The Mythical Man-month” <span class="citation" data-cites="Brooks:mythical75">(Brooks, n.d.)</span>, has itself gained almost mythical status in the community. It focuses on what has become known as Brooks’ law “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”.</p>
<p>Adding people (men or women!) to a project delays it because of the communication overhead required to get people up to speed.</p>
<h2 id="separation-of-concerns">Separation of Concerns</h2>
<p>To construct such complex systems an approach known as “separation of concerns” has been developed. The idea is that you architect your system, which consists of a large-scale complex task, into a set of simpler tasks. Each of these tasks is separately implemented. This is known as the decomposition of the task.</p>
<p>This is where Jonathan Zittrain’s beautifully named term “intellectual debt” rises to the fore. Separation of concerns enables the construction of a complex system. But who is concerned with the overall system?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical debt is the inability to <em>maintain</em> your complex software system.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual debt is the inability to <em>explain</em> your software system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is right there in our approach to software engineering. “Separation of concerns” means no one is concerned about the overall system itself.</p>
<h2 id="adding-data">Adding Data</h2>
<p><span style="text-align:right"><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ai/includes/data-and-intellectual-debt.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ai/includes/data-and-intellectual-debt.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></span></p>
<p>This does lead to technical debt, but more perniciously it leads to intellectual debt. Even if your system is functioning, you struggle to explain how and why it is working.</p>
<p>This situation is not good enough, but it becomes far worse when data is involved.</p>
<p>With the introduction of machine learning we see three principle effects in these complex systems.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Machine learning models are being deployed as regular software; this means their very existence in the complex infrastructure is not being declared. Maybe Lancelot knows, but he’s likely too busy dealing with some other issue.</p>
<p>This is a challenge because the machine learning model has a sell-by date. It is trained and validated on data from a particular time period which reflects a particular snapshot of the population. In practice the statistical population will evolve, and the quality of the model with decay over time. Unless the team placed in particular infrastructure to monitor this performance loss (which they often don’t, because they are under pressure to deploy). The time frame over which a model can become stale can be extremely short, because often the very deployment of a model (if done at scale) effects the dynamics of data production rendering the training data non-representative.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>In the rush to adopt “AI” and make use of machine learning technology, standard software engineering sanity checks are often suspended because people are told that ‘machine learning is different’. It is indeed different; it is much worse than standard software in its potential failure modes and extra safeguards need to be put in place.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual models are sometimes difficult to interpret and there is potential for bias to enter in the modelling or from the data. Performance of these models is normally measured empirically and is therefore driven by the ‘average case’. Exceptional circumstances are often handled extremely badly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are beginning to broach the subject of intellectual debt around the interpretability of individual models. And indeed, there is a field known as Fairness, Accountability and Transparency Machine learning that is looking to address these issues for single models. This is where, unfortunately, the death of the programmer enters.</p>
<h2 id="fit-models-to-fit-systems">FIT Models to FIT Systems</h2>
<p><span style="text-align:right"><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ai/includes/fit-systems.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ai/includes/fit-systems.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></span></p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”. Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual, because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>
<p>So, this is where, my understanding of intellectual debt in ML systems departs, I believe from John Zittrain’s. The long-term challenge is <em>not</em> in the individual model. We have excellent statistical tools for validating what any individual model, the long-term challenge is the complex interaction between different components in the decomposed system, where the original intent of each component has been forgotten (except perhaps by Lancelot) and each service has been repurposed. We need to move from FIT models to FIT systems.</p>
<p>How to address these challenges? With collaborators I’ve been working towards a solution that contains broadly two parts. The first part is what we refer to as “Data-Oriented Architectures”. The second part is “meta modelling”, machine learning techniques that help us model the models.</p>
<h2 id="data-oriented-architectures">Data-oriented Architectures</h2>
<p><span style="text-align:right"><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/data-oriented-architectures-short.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/data-oriented-architectures-short.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></span></p>
<p>Data-oriented architectures aim to address the rat’s nest that is the current interaction between the services in a service-oriented architecture. It does this by introducing data-oriented programming. The data-oriented programming language tracks the movement of data between each service.</p>
<p>Service-oriented programming style is a necessary, but not sufficient approach to data-oriented programming. Data-oriented programming is not only about the individual services, but how they are connected. Which service is calling which and where the flow of the data through the system occurs?</p>
<p>If each service has its inputs and outputs declared on a wider ecosystem, then we can programmatically determine which inputs effect which decisions. This programmatic discovery is vital because as systems are built compositionally, the actual inputs that affect a final decision may not be known to any of the software engineers who are maintaining the system.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>At Amazon my team built a <em>data-oriented programming</em> language which is <a href="https://github.com/amzn/milan">now available through BSD license</a>. The language is called Milan. The team was led by Tom Borchert, quoting from <a href="https://tborchertblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/13/28/">Tom’s blog on Milan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Milan has three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A general-purpose stream algebra that encodes relationships between data streams (the Milan Intermediate Language or Milan IL)</p></li>
<li><p>A Scala library for building programs in that algebra.</p></li>
<li><p>A compiler that takes programs expressed in Milan IL and produces a Flink application that executes the program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Component (2) can be extended to support interfaces in additional languages, and component (3) can be extended to support additional runtime targets. Considering just the multiple interfaces and the multiple runtimes, Milan looks a lot like the much more mature Apache Beam. The difference lies in (1), Milan’s general-purpose stream algebra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is through the general-purpose stream algebra that we hope to make significant inroads on the intellectual debt challenge.</p>
<p>The stream algebra defines the relationship between different machine learning components in the wider software architecture. Composition of multiple services cannot occur without a signature existing within the stream algebra. The Milan IL becomes the key information structure that is required to reason about the wider software system.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>This deals with the challenges that arise through the <em>death of the programmer</em> because we can now see the context around each service. This allows us to design the relevant validation checks to ensure that accuracy and fairness are maintained. By recompiling the algebra to focus on a particular decision within the system we can also derive new statistical tests to validate performance. These are the checks that we refer to as progression testing. The loss of programmer control means that we can no longer rely on software tests written at design time, we must have the capability to deploy new (statistical) tests after deployment as the uses to which each service is placed extend to previously un-envisaged domains.</p>
<h2 id="stateless-services">Stateless Services</h2>
<p>Importantly, Milan does not place onerous constraints on the builders of individual machine learning models (or other components). Standard modelling frameworks can be used. The main constraint is that any code that is not visible to the ecosystem does not maintain or store global state. This condition implies that the parameters of any machine learning model need to also be declared as an input to the model within the Milan IL.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Where does machine learning come in? The strategy I propose is that the Milan IL is integrated with meta-modelling approaches to assist in the explanation of the decision-making framework. At their simplest these approaches may be novelty detection algorithms on the data streams that are emerging from a given service. This is a form of <em>progression testing</em>. But we can go much further. By knowing the training data, the inputs and outputs of the individual services in the software ecosystem, we can build meta-models that test for fairness, accuracy not just of individual system components, but short or long cascades of decision making. Through the use of the Milan IL algebra all these tests could be automatically deployed. The focus of machine learning is on the models-that-model-the-models. The meta-models.</p>
<p>In Amazon, our own focus was on the use of statistical emulators, sometimes known as surrogate models, for fulfilling this task. The work we were putting into this route is available through another software package, <a href="https://amzn.github.io/emukit/">Emukit, a framework for decision making under uncertainty</a>. With collaborators my current focus for addressing these issues is a form of fusion of Emukit and Milan (Milemukit??). But the nature of this fusion requires testing on real world problem sets. A task we hope to carry out in close collaboration with colleagues at <a href="http://www.datascienceafrica.org/">Data Science Africa</a>.</p>
