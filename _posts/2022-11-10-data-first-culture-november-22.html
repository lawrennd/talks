title: "Data First Culture"
venue: "Advanced Leadership Programme, Judge Business School, Cambridge"
abstract: "<p>Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving
from a manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be
rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital
transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers,
logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges may
start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the notion of
‘post digital transformation’: the challenges of doing business in a
digital world.</p>"
