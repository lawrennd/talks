<p>Anecdotally, talking to data modelling scientists. Most say they spend 80% of their time acquiring and cleaning data. This is precipitating what I refer to as the “data crisis”. This is an analogy with software. The “software crisis” was the phenomenon of inability to deliver software solutions due to increasing complexity of implementation. There was no single shot solution for the software crisis, it involved better practice (scrum, test orientated development, sprints, code review), improved programming paradigms (object orientated, functional) and better tools (CVS, then SVN, then git).</p>
<p>However, these challenges aren’t new, they are merely taking a different form. From the computer’s perspective software <em>is</em> data. The first wave of the data crisis was known as the <em>software crisis</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-software-crisis">The Software Crisis</h3>
<p>In the late sixties early software programmers made note of the increasing costs of software development and termed the challenges associated with it as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis">Software Crisis</a>”. Edsger Dijkstra referred to the crisis in his 1972 Turing Award winner’s address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.</p>
<p>Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002), The Humble Programmer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high-quality data. That implies that we develop processes for improving and verifying data quality that are efficient.</p>
<p>There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possible we should automate work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I term “The Data Crisis” is the modern equivalent of this problem. The quantity of modern data, and the lack of attention paid to data as it is initially “laid down” and the costs of data cleaning are bringing about a crisis in data-driven decision making. This crisis is at the core of the challenge of <em>technical debt</em> in machine learning <span class="citation" data-cites="Sculley:debt15">(Sculley et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Just as with software, the crisis is most correctly addressed by ‘scaling’ the manner in which we process our data. Duplication of work occurs because the value of data cleaning is not correctly recognised in management decision making processes. Automation of work is increasingly possible through techniques in “artificial intelligence”, but this will also require better management of the data science pipeline so that data about data science (meta-data science) can be correctly assimilated and processed. The Alan Turing institute has a program focussed on this area, <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/">AI for Data Analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-science-as-debugging-edit">Data Science as Debugging <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/data-science-as-debugging.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/data-science-as-debugging.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h2>
<p>One challenge for existing information technology professionals is realizing the extent to which a software ecosystem based on data differs from a classical ecosystem. In particular, by ingesting data we bring unknowns/uncontrollables into our decision-making system. This presents opportunity for adversarial exploitation and unforeseen operation.</p>
<p>You can also check my blog post on <a href="http://inverseprobability.com/2017/03/14/data-science-as-debugging">“Data Science as Debugging”</a>..</p>
<p>Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data science is somewhat difference from classical software engineering.</p>
<p>One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of change we need is the following. Imagine as a software engineer, you find a USB stick on the ground. And for some reason you <em>know</em> that on that USB stick is a particular API call that will enable you to make a significant positive difference on a business problem. You don’t know which of the many library functions on the USB stick are the ones that will help. And it could be that some of those library functions will hinder, perhaps because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because they have been placed there maliciously. The most secure thing to do would be to <em>not</em> introduce this code into your production system at all. But what if your manager told you to do so, how would you go about incorporating this code base?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>very</em> carefully. You would have to engage in a process more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into this line of code than any line of code you have written before.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of the code base is understood, software tests to verify it also need to be constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of software you write to actually interact with the software on the USB stick are likely to be minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than perhaps any other lines of code in the system.</p>
<p>Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system, it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We cannot rely on an individual’s decision making to ensure the quality of all our systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality controls, checks and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.</p>
<p>This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data in our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarially produced. A further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on the USB stick is evolving over time.</p>
<p>It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we simply need to check what the formal software engineering process is for debugging, because that is the current software engineering activity that data science is closest to. But when we look for a formalization of debugging, we find that there is none. Indeed, modern software engineering mainly focusses on ensuring that code is written without bugs in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Anecdotally, resolving a machine learning challenge requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the data and perhaps 20% to be focused on the model. But many companies are too keen to employ machine learning engineers who focus on the models, not the data. We should change our hiring priorities and training. Universities cannot provide the understanding of how to data-wrangle. Companies must fill this gap.</p>

<h3 id="three-grades-of-data-readiness-edit">Three Grades of Data Readiness <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/three-grades-of-data-readiness.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/three-grades-of-data-readiness.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h3>
<p>Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate stages of data graduation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade C - accessibility
<ul>
<li>Transition: data becomes electronically available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade B - validity
<ul>
<li>Transition: pose a question to the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade A - usability</li>
</ul>
<p>The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade C data to Grade B data is delimited by the <em>electronic availability</em> of the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is delimited by posing a question or task to the data <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:drl17">(Lawrence 2017)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-grade-c">Accessibility: Grade C</h2>
<p>The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data science practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who, perhaps having had little experience of data-science before, state that they “have the data”. More often than not, they have not verified this. A convenient term for this is “Hearsay Data”, someone has <em>heard</em> that they have the data so they <em>say</em> they have it. This is the lowest grade of data readiness.</p>
<p>Progressing through Grade C involves ensuring that this data is accessible. Not just in terms of digital accessiblity, but also for regulatory, ethical and intellectual property reasons.</p>
<h2 id="validity-grade-b">Validity: Grade B</h2>
<p>Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital analysis on the computer. Once the challenges of access to the data have been resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for direct loading into analysis software (such as Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica or SPSS). Once this has occured the data is at B4 level. Grade B involves the <em>validity</em> of the data. Does the data really represent what it purports to? There are challenges such as missing values, outliers, record duplication. Each of these needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>Grade B and C are important as if the work done in these grades is documented well, it can be reused in other projects. Reuse of this labour is key to reducing the costs of data-driven automated decision making. There is a strong overlap between the work required in this grade and the statistical field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"><em>exploratory data analysis</em></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Tukey:exploratory77">(Tukey 1977)</span>.</p>
<p>The need for Grade B emerges due to the fundamental change in the availability of data. Classically, the scientific question came first, and the data came later. This is still the approach in a randomized control trial, e.g. in A/B testing or clinical trials for drugs. Today data is being laid down by happenstance, and the question we wish to ask about the data often comes after the data has been created. The Grade B of data readiness ensures thought can be put into data quality <em>before</em> the question is defined. It is this work that is reusable across multiple teams. It is these processes that the team which is <em>standing up</em> the data must deliver.</p>
<h2 id="usability-grade-a">Usability: Grade A</h2>
<p>Once the validity of the data is determined, the data set can be considered for use in a particular task. This stage of data readiness is more akin to what machine learning scientists are used to doing in Universities. Bringing an algorithm to bear on a well understood data set.</p>
<p>In Grade A we are concerned about the utility of the data given a particular task. Grade A may involve additional data collection (experimental design in statistics) to ensure that the task is fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is the stage where the data and the model are brought together, so expertise in learning algorithms and their application is key. Further ethical considerations, such as the fairness of the resulting predictions are required at this stage. At the end of this stage a prototype model is ready for deployment.</p>
<p>Deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in production is another important issue which Data Readiness Levels are only a part of the solution for.</p>

<p>Throughout the data preparation pipeline, it is important to have close interaction between data scientists and application domain experts. Decisions on data preparation taken outside the context of application have dangerous downstream consequences. This provides an additional burden on the data scientist as they are required for each project, but it should also be seen as a learning and familiarization exercise for the domain expert. Long term, just as biologists have found it necessary to assimilate the skills of the bioinformatician to be effective in their science, most domains will also require a familiarity with the nature of data driven decision making and its application. Working closely with data-scientists on data preparation is one way to begin this sharing of best practice.</p>
<p>The processes involved in Grade C and B are often badly taught in courses on data science. Perhaps not due to a lack of interest in the areas, but maybe more due to a lack of access to real world examples where data quality is poor.</p>
<p>These stages of data science are also ridden with ambiguity. In the long term they could do with more formalization, and automation, but best practice needs to be understood by a wider community before that can happen.</p>
