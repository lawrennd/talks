abstract: |
  In the second part of this tutorial we will develop non linear
  approaches to dimensionality reduction from the probabilistic
  perspective. Firstly we will briefly review a probabilistic perspectives
  on spectral approaches, and then we will build on the non-linear
  approaches we derived using Gaussian processes in the first part of the
  tutorial. We will show extensions which include the stacking of Gaussian
  process models to give deep Gaussian processes, a probabilistic model
  for unsupervised learning.
