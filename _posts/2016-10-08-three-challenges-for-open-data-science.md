title: Three Challenges for Open Data Science
abstract: 'Data science presents new opportunities but also new challenges. In this
  talk we will focus on three separate challenges for data science: 1. Paradoxes of
  the Data Society, 2. Quantifying the Value of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of control,
  marginalization. Each of these challenges has particular implications for data science.
  The paradoxes relate to our evolving relationship with data and our changing expectations.
  Quantifying value is vital for accounting for the influence of data in our new digital
  economies and issues of privacy and loss of control are fundamental to how our pre-existing
  rights evolve as the digital world encroaches more closely on the physical. One
  of the goals of open data science should be to address these challenges to ensure
  that we can avoid the pitfalls of the data driven society, allowing us to reap the
  benefits of data science in applications from personalized health to the developing
  world.'
