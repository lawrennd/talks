title: "From Innovation to Deployment"
subtitle: "Machine Learning Systems Design"
abstract: >
  The AI systems we are developing and deploying are based on
  interconnected machine learning components. There is a need for 
  AI-assisted design and monitoring of these systems to ensure they perform
  robustly, safely and accurately in their deployed environment. We address 
  the entire pipeline of AI system development, from data acquisition to 
  decision making. 
  
  Data Oriented Architectures are an ecosystem that includes system monitoring for performance, 
  interpretability and fairness.

\notes{The first two components *decomposition* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}
