\newslide{Why a New Journal?}

The RSS has a long history of producing world-class publications, with our first journal dating back to 1838. However, we recognized a need in the rapidly evolving landscape of data science and AI.

\notes{This new journal reflects the increasing importance of these disciplines in science and society.}

\newslide{Our Vision}

Our vision for this journal is threefold:

1. To help unify various "AI and data science" fields
2. To combine technical details with important questions and applications
3. To facilitate critical questions about emerging technologies

\newslide{Unifying Data Science Fields}

We aim to bring together high-quality papers with broad interest across:

- Machine Learning
- Statistics
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Bioinformatics
- Econometrics
- And more

\notes{By creating this common ground, we hope to foster collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas across these interrelated fields.}

\newslide{Technical Details and Important Questions}

The journal will focus on papers that:

- Present robust technical content
- Address significant questions or concepts of broad interest
- Demonstrate important applications

\notes{This combination ensures that the research published is not only technically sound but also relevant and impactful.}

\newslide{Critical Perspectives on Emerging Technologies}

We encourage papers that explore:

- Responsible Algorithms: Robustness, Fairness and Privacy of AI/ML systems
- Reliability of data-driven solutions
- Epistemological questions in data science

\newslide{Editorial Board}

We've assembled a distinguished editorial board led by:

- Silvia Chiappa (Google DeepMind and UCL)
- Sach Mukherjee (DZNE, University of Bonn, and University of Cambridge)
- Myself, Neil Lawrence (University of Cambridge)

\notes{Our board members represent diverse expertise across academia and industry, ensuring comprehensive peer review.}

\newslide{Editorial Board Members}

Our board includes experts from various institutions:

- Kyle Cranmer (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
- Borja De Balle Pigem (Google DeepMind)
- Arnaud Doucet (Google DeepMind)
- Sandrine Dudoit (University of California, Berkeley)
- Arnoldo Frigessi (University of Oslo)
- Anthony Lee (University of Bristol)
- Maria Liakata (Queen Mary University of London)

\newslide{}

- Nicolai Meinshausen (ETH ZÃ¼rich)
- Kevin Murphy (Google DeepMind)
- Tom Nichols (University of Oxford)
- Uri Shalit (Technion)
- Isabel Valera (Saarland University)
- Andrew Gordon Wilson (New York University)

\newslide{Expertise Coverage}

Our editorial board covers a wide range of expertise:

* Machine Learning and AI: Chiappa, Lawrence, Mukherjee, Cranmer, De Balle Pigem, Murphy, Wilson
* Statistical Methodology: Doucet, Dudoit, Lee, Meinshausen, Nichols, Frigessi
* Biostatistics and Computational Biology: Dudoit, Frigessi, Mukherjee, Nichols
* Natural Language Processing: Liakata
* Neuroimaging: Nichols
* Causal Inference: Shalit, Meinshausen, Valera, Mukherjee

\notes{This diverse expertise ensures comprehensive and rigorous peer review across the spectrum of data science and AI research.}

\newslide{Open Access and Submission Policy}

RSS: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence is:

- Fully open access
- Following a submission policy similar to JMLR (accept submissions published at workshops or conferences, permit pre-print publication (such as arXiv))
- Committed to rigorous peer review

\notes{This approach ensures wide accessibility of cutting-edge research while maintaining high standards of quality.}

\newslide{Call for Papers}

We invite submissions in areas including but not limited to:

- Novel methodologies in AI and ML
- Statistical approaches to big data
- Ethical considerations in data science
- Interdisciplinary applications of AI/ML

\newslide{Conclusion}

\notes{RSS: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence represents an exciting new chapter for the Royal Statistical Society. We believe it will serve as a crucial platform for advancing knowledge and fostering critical discussions in this rapidly evolving field.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your contributions and to the impactful research this journal will showcase.}

\thanks
