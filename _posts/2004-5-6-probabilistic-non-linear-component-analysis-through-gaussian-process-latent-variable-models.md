title: Probabilistic Non-linear Component Analysis through Gaussian Process Latent
  Variable Models
abstract: |
  It is known that Principal Component Analysis has an underlying
  probabilistic representation based on a latent variable model. PCA is
  recovered when the latent variables are integrated out and the
  parameters of the model are optimised by maximum likelihood. It is less
  well known that the dual approach of integrating out the parameters and
  optimising with respect to the latent variables also leads to PCA. The
  marginalised likelihood in this case takes the form of Gaussian process
  mappings, with linear Covariance functions, from a latent space to an
  observed space, which we refer to as a Gaussian Process Latent Variable
  Model (GPLVM) :gplvm03 . It is straightforward to ‘non-linearise’ this
  model by substituting the linear covariance function for a non-linear
  one. The result is a non-linear probabilistic PCA model. In this talk we
  will present a practical algorithm for optimising the latent variables
  in a non-linear GPLVM and discuss some relations with other models.
  Finally we will present results from a SIGGRAPH paper which uses the
  GPLVM to learn styles in an inverse kinematics problem :styleik04.
