title: Probabilistic Approaches for Computational Biology and Medicine
abstract: In this talk I’ll discuss some of the challenges in personalized medicine
  and consider some of the implications for machine learning models. I’ll introduce
  the probabilistic approach to machine learning, with a particular focus on Gaussian
  models. Giving some examples of applications I’ll discuss Bayesian approaches to
  regression modelling and lead into Gaussian process models.
