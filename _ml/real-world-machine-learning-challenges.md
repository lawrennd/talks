title: "Real World Machine Learning Challenges"
abstract: >
  Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the 
  current revolution in “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines and is having a 
  significant influence on the wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with machine learning solutions, and what challenges 
  we face both in the near and far future. These include practical application of existing algorithms in the 
  face of the need to explain decision making, mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data, 
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.
