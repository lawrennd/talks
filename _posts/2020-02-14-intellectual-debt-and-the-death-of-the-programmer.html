title: "Intellectual Debt and the Death of the Programmer"
venue: "Distinguished Lecture Series on Information Engineering"
abstract: "Technical debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought as to how they will be <em>maintained</em>. Intellectual debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought to how they’ll be <em>explained</em>. Both problems are pervasise in the design and deployment of large scale algorithmic decision making engines. In this talk we’ll review the origin of the problem, and propose a roadmap for obtaining solutions. It’s a journey that will require collaboration between industry, academia third sector, and regulatory bodies."
