title: Applications of Gaussian Processes in Computational Biology
abstract: |
  In this talk we will give a brief overview of Gaussian processes and a
  quick review of how they can be applied to solve questions in
  computational biology. In particular we will show how we can construct
  covariance functions to solve simple tasks (like differential
  expression) or more complex tasks (like unpicking regulatory networks).
