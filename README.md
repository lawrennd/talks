Talks from Neil Lawrence

To create talks from these files you need to access the python package `maketalk`.

You can install that with

```
pip install git+git://github.com/lawrennd/maketalk.git
```

The talks folder is organized as follows.

Each general subject comes under a sub-directory 

```
_subject/
```

Under that subject, there are a series of talks. Each as a markdown file. These files include various talk files from different parts of the site. They are also allocated to different subject files, under the includes subdirectory.

```
_subject/includes/
```
