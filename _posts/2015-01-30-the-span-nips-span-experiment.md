title: The <span>NIPS</span> Experiment
venue: RADIANT Meeting, University of Zurich, Switzerland
year: '2015'
month: 1
abstract: The peer review process can be difficult to navigate for newcomers. In this
  informal talk we will review the results of the NIPS experiment, an experiment on
  the repeatability of peer review conducted for the 2014 conference. We will try
  to keep the presentation information to ensure questions can be asked. With luck
  it will give more insight into the processes that a program committee goes through
  when selecting papers.
