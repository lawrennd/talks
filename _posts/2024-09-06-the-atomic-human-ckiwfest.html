title: "The Atomic Human"
venue: "CKIWfest (willickifest)"
abstract: "<p>A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re
having about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our
identity?</p>
<p>Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI not
only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied
threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the
centre of the world.</p>
<p>Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components: eventually
we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek for uncuttable is
‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the facets of human
intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI uncovers what is left:
an indivisible core that is the essence of humanity.</p>
<p>By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations
of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just by the experts,
but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or we become a tool of
AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose the future we want.</p>"

<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Jean Dominique Bauby suffered
from locked-in syndrome. The embodiment factors show that relative to
the machine we are also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment
as the length of time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of
computation. For computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human,
whether locked in or not, it is a matter of many millions of years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. Claude Shannon introduced a mathematical
concept of information for the purposes of understanding telephone
exchanges.</p>
<p>Information has many meanings, but mathematically, Shannon defined a
bit of information to be the amount of information you get from tossing
a coin.</p>
<p>If I toss a coin, and look at it, I know the answer. You don’t. But
if I now tell you the answer I communicate to you 1 bit of information.
Shannon defined this as the fundamental unit of information.</p>
<p>If I toss the coin twice, and tell you the result of both tosses, I
give you two bits of information. Information is additive.</p>
<p>Shannon also estimated the average information associated with the
English language. He estimated that the average information in any word
is 12 bits, equivalent to twelve coin tosses.</p>
<p>So every two minutes Bauby was able to communicate 12 bits, or six
bits per minute.</p>
<p>This is the information transfer rate he was limited to, the rate at
which he could communicate.</p>
<p>Compare this to me, talking now. The average speaker for TEDX speaks
around 160 words per minute. That’s 320 times faster than Bauby or
around a 2000 bits per minute. 2000 coin tosses per minute.</p>
<p>But, just think how much thought Bauby was putting into every
sentence. Imagine how carefully chosen each of his words was. Because he
was communication constrained he could put more thought into each of his
words. Into thinking about his audience.</p>
<p>So, his intelligence became locked in. He thinks as fast as any of
us, but can communicate slower. Like the tree falling in the woods with
no one there to hear it, his intelligence is embedded inside him.</p>
<p>Two thousand coin tosses per minute sounds pretty impressive, but
this talk is not just about us, it’s about our computers, and the type
of intelligence we are creating within them.</p>
<p>So how does two thousand compare to our digital companions? When
computers talk to each other, they do so with billions of coin tosses
per minute.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine for a moment, that instead of talking about
communication of information, we are actually talking about money. Bauby
would have 6 dollars. I would have 2000 dollars, and my computer has
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The internet has interconnected computers and equipped them with
extremely high transfer rates.</p>
<p>However, by our very best estimates, computers actually think slower
than us.</p>
<p>How can that be? You might ask, computers calculate much faster than
me. That’s true, but underlying your conscious thoughts there are a lot
of calculations going on.</p>
<p>Each thought involves many thousands, millions or billions of
calculations. How many exactly, we don’t know yet, because we don’t know
how the brain turns calculations into thoughts.</p>
<p>Our best estimates suggest that to simulate your brain a computer
would have to be as large as the UK Met Office machine here in Exeter.
That’s a 250 million pound machine, the fastest in the UK. It can do 16
billion billon calculations per second.</p>
<p>It simulates the weather across the word every day, that’s how much
power we think we need to simulate our brains.</p>
<p>So, in terms of our computational power we are extraordinary, but in
terms of our ability to explain ourselves, just like Bauby, we are
locked in.</p>
<p>For a typical computer, to communicate everything it computes in one
second, it would only take it a couple of minutes. For us to do the same
would take 15 billion years.</p>
<p>If intelligence is fundamentally about processing and sharing of
information. This gives us a fundamental constraint on human
intelligence that dictates its nature.</p>
<p>I call this ratio between the time it takes to compute something, and
the time it takes to say it, the embodiment factor <span
class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:embodiment17">(Lawrence,
2017)</span>. Because it reflects how embodied our cognition is.</p>
<p>If it takes you two minutes to say the thing you have thought in a
second, then you are a computer. If it takes you 15 billion years, then
you are a human.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads

</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the
modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction

the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges

</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

money and water flow. The MONIAC exploits this through a system of
tanks, pipes, valves and floats that represent the flow of money through
the UK economy. Water flowed from the treasury tank at the top of the
model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health
and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support
but was also found to be a useful economic simulator. Several were built

<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative models, particularly large
language models, have enabled machines that, for the first time, can
converse plausibly with other humans.</p>
<p>The Apollo guidance computer provided Armstrong with an analogy when
he landed it on the Moon. He controlled it through a stick which
provided him with an analogy. The analogy is based in the experience
that Amelia Earhart had when she flew her plane. Armstrong’s control
exploited his experience as a test pilot flying planes that had control
columns which were directly connected to their control surfaces.</p>

“AI” of science fiction. Because their intelligence is based on
emulating human knowledge. Through being forced to reproduce our
literature and our art they have developed aspects which are analogous
to the cultural proxy truths we use to describe our world.</p>
<p>These machines are to humans what the MONIAC was the British economy.
Not a replacement, but an analogue computer that captures some aspects
of humanity while providing advantages of high bandwidth of the
machine.</p>

<p>The Human-Analogue Machine or HAM therefore provides a route through
which we could better understand our world through improving the way we
interact with machines.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the
modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction
of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the
computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>

<p>The HAM can provide an interface between the digital computer and the
human allowing humans to work closely with computers regardless of their
understandin gf the more technical parts of software engineering.</p>

<p>Of course this route provides new routes for manipulation, new ways
in which the machine can undermine our autonomy or exploit our cognitive
foibles. The major challenge we face is steering between these worlds
where we gain the advantage of the computer’s bandwidth without
undermining our culture and individual autonomy.</p>
