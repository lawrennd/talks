title: "The Power and Pitfalls of Machine Learning in the Design of New
Molecules"
venue: "Oxford Schmidt AI in Science Annual Lecture"
abstract: "<p>AI is currently revolutionising science. It is helping us
to discover more promising candidates for therapeutic drugs; it is being
used to generate more accurate weather forecasts; and it is at the
forefront of efforts to tackle the biodiversity and climate crises. At
this inaugural event, we explore the effects that AI is already having
on science and those areas of science soon to be influenced.</p>
<p>Professor Charlotte Deane MBE delivers our plenary talk, “The power
and pitfalls of Machine Learning in the design of new molecules”.
Professor Deane is Executive Chair of the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council, and Professor of Structural Bioinformatics in
the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, where she
leads the Oxford Protein Informatics Group.</p>
<p>Following her talk, Professor Deane discusses “AI as the main driver
for future science” in a panel session including:</p>
<p>Professor Louise Slater is Professor of Hydroclimatology and Tutorial
Fellow at Hertford College, University of Oxford. Louise leads the
Hydro-Climate Extremes Research Group, which develops computational
approaches to detect, attribute and predict how changes in climate and
land cover may affect water-related extremes and society.</p>
<p>Professor Neil Lawrence is the inaugural DeepMind Professor of
Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge. He has been working on
machine learning models for over 20 years and recently returned to
academia after three years as Director of Machine Learning at Amazon.
His main interest is the interaction of machine learning with the
physical world.</p>
<p>The panel is chaired by Professor Stephen Roberts, Professor of
Machine Learning and Professorial Fellow at Somerville College,
University of Oxford. Stephen is co-lead of Oxford’s Schmidt AI in
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme.</p>"
