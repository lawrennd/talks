title: "Bayesian Methods"
abstract: "In his philosophical essay on probabilities, Laplace motivated the deterministic universe as a *straw man* in terms of driving predictions. He suggested ignorance of data and models drives the need to turn to probability. Bayesian formalisms deal with uncertainty in parameters of the model. 

In this lecture we review the Bayesian formalism in the context of linear models, reviewing initially maximum likelihood and introducing basis functions as a way of driving non-linearity in the model."
