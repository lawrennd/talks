title: "Celsius Lecture"
abstract: >
  With breakthroughs in understanding images, translating language,
  transcribing speech artificial intelligence promises to
  revolutionise the technological landscape. Machine learning
  algorithms are able to convert unstructured data into actionable
  knowledge. With the increasing impact of these technologies,
  societyâ€™s interest is also growing.

  The word intelligence conjures notions of human-like
  capabilities. But are we really on the cusp of creating machines
  that match us? We associate intelligence with knowledge, but in this
  talk I will argue that the true marvel of our intelligence is the
  way it deals with ignorance.

  Despite the large strides forward we have made, I will argue that we
  have a long way to go to deliver on the promise of artificial
  intelligence. And it is a journey that our societies need to take
  together, not just as computer scientists, but together by
  rediscovering the interdisciplinary spirit that Celsius, Linnaeus
  and their contemporaries did so much to demonstrate.

>Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it---an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis---it would embrace in the same formulate the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present in its eyes.

> But if we conceive a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are still as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is at present impossible to us. For we have seen that the molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B, by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B, and the only the slower ones to pass from B to A. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of B and lower that of A, in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.

\speakernotes{I have a great dislike for Russell; I cannot explain it completely, but I feel a detestation for the man. As far as any sympathy with me, or with anyone else, I believe, he is an iceberg. His mind impresses one as a keen, cold, narrow logical machine, that cuts the universe into neat little packets, that measure, as it were, just three inches each way. His type of mathematical analysis he applies as a sort of Procrustean bed to the facts, and those that contain more than his system provides for, he lops short, and those that contain less, he draws out.

\section{ARTIFICIAL}

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}

\notes{One of the struggles of artificial intelligence is that the term means different things to different people. Our intelligence is precious to us, and the notion that it can be easily recreated is disturbing to us. This leads to some dystopian notions of artificial intelligence, such as the singularity.}

\notes{Depending on whether this powerful technology is viewed as beneficent or maleficent, it can be viewed either as a helpful assistant, in the manner of Jeeves, or a tyrannical dictator.}

\include{_ai/includes/ai-as-manservant.md}

\notes{The history of automation and technology is a history of us adapting to technological change. The invention of the railways, and the need for consistent national times to timetable our movements. The development of the factory system in the mills of Derbyshire required workers to operate and maintain the machines that replaced them.}

\newslide{}

> Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply PAGE 185a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.

\notes{Yes, something like that is a good idea. I'm going to start a small document.

22nd sounds sensible.

I think bringing together the Accelerate, Turing and McGovern work could be interesting. Putting together under a theme â€¦ maybe that is supply chain of ideas. But need to relate that to passage of information and perhaps the role for ML in society??

How about I send out an invite for the afternoon of 22 January? (Give you a week or so of adjusting to term starting, but 3 weeks to make changes before the event?)
 
Also happy to kick around ideas before that, if useful. Feels like you could tie together intellectual debt and supply chain of ideas (what happens when you speed up the pace of coconut production?) and the characteristics you need for AI systems to work well with people.

Oooo! I was thinking about this the other day â€“ we could do a test run on this with the group. Sort of a dress rehearsal, if you want to try out different lines or ideas? But also a way of contributing to the process of introducing ML@CL and Accelerate to each other.

Hi Neil, 
 
We have a new initiative here at the university AI4Research where the focus is on developing AI/ML and in particular the use of AI/ML at a tool to develop other disciplines (medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.). Some background on the project is available here https://uu.se/en/research/ai4research/  and when I was asked to write about the ideas it resulted in this
https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/news/article/?id=14730&typ=artikel&lang=en
 
If you like these ideas and have a story that somehow aligns with this that would be great. However, I definitely do not want to force you into talking about this topic, I only mentioning it since you asked for some concrete ideas.
 
In any case, it is important that your talk is broadly accessible to a wide audience (Technology and Natural Science) at the same time as it remains scientific, which is of course the challenge with talks of this kind. 
 
Hope this can be of some help?
 
Best,
Thomas
