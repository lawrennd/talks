title: 'Computer Vision Reading Group: The <span>G</span>aussian Process Latent Variable
  Model'
abstract: The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) is a recently proposed
  probabilistic approach to obtaining a reduced dimension representation of a data
  set. In this tutorial we motivate and describe the GP-LVM, giving a review of the
  model itself and some of the concepts behind it.
