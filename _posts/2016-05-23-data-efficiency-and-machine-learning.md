title: Data Efficiency and Machine Learning
abstract: Entropy is a key component of information and probability, and may provide
  the key to *data efficient* learning. While weâ€™ve seen great success with the AlphaGo
  computer program and strides forward in image and speech recognition our current
  machine learning systems are incredibly data inefficient. Better understanding of
  entropy with in these systems may provide the key to data efficient learning.
