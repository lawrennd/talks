abstract: A popular approach to collaborative filtering is matrix factorization. In
  this talk we consider the “probabilistic matrix factorization” and by taking a latent
  variable model perspective we show its equivalence to Bayesian PCA. This inspires
  us to consider probabilistic PCA and its non-linear extension, the Gaussian process
  latent variable model (GP-LVM) as an approach for probabilistic non-linear matrix
  factorization. We apply out approach to benchmark movie recommender data sets. The
  results show better than previous state-of-the-art performance.
