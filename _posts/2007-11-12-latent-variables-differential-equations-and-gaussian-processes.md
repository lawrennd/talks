title: Latent Variables, Differential Equations and Gaussian Processes
abstract: 'We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent variable.
  Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn from a distribution,
  e.g. probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This simplification is often extended
  for temporal data where tractable Markovian independence assumptions are used (e.g.
  Kalman filters or hidden Markov models). In this talk we will consider such models
  in the context of a biological problem: inferring transcription factor activities
  in simple transcription networks. We will extend the simpler formalisms described
  above to consider the case where the latent variable is a ’latent function’ and
  the relationship with the observed data is described by a linear differential equation.
  Through the use of a Gaussian process prior over the latent function we can perform
  inference tractably and learn parameters of interest in the system.'
