title: "The Great AI Fallacy"
venue: "The Cambridge Network"
abstract: "Artificial intelligence is a form of intellectual automation. The promise of artificial intelligence is that it will be the first generation of automation that adapts to humans, rather than humans having to adapt to it. I see no evidence that this is true, but this fallacy is having very real effects on the way we think about creating and deploying artificial intelligence solutions. In this talk I introduce the Great AI Fallacy and discuss strategies for deployment that pre-emptively deal with the problems it will trigger."
