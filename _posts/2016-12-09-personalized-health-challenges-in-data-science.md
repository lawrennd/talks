title: "Personalized Health: Challenges in Data Science"
abstract: The promise of personalized health is driven by the wide availability of data, but we don't need to talk so much about where we want to be, rather how we should get there. What are the challenges that need to be bridged technologically to unlock the potential in the much greater availability of data we now have. In this talk we'll consider three challenges of data science in the context of personalized health, the three challenges each need to be bridged to bring the era of true precision, or personalized, medicine within the reach of an affordable health care service.
