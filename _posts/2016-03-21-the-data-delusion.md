title: The Data Delusion
abstract: The race on to develop the next generation of artificially intelligent algorithms,
  recent successes in hitherto unmanageable problems have somewhat blinded us to our
  own capabilities. Despite the commercial success of the current generation of learning
  algorithms, the time has come for the academic community to take stock. Have we
  really got the tools in place to solve the next generation of learning problems?
  Or is our current confidence in our toolsets misplaced? In this talk weâ€™ll develop
  at least one direction where our capabilities are lacking.
