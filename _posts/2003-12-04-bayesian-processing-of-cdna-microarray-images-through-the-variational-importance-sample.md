title: Bayesian Processing of {cDNA} Microarray Images through the Variational Importance
  Sampler
abstract: 'Each cell in the human body contains the same basic code in the form of
  the genome, however cells have differentiated roles which come about through different
  cells ‘expressing’ different genes. Key insights into gene interactions can be studied
  through measuring the level of expression of each gene at different times. Gene
  expression levels can be obtained from cDNA microarray experiments through the extraction
  of pixel intensities from a scanned image of a slide. In this talk we will start
  by briefly reviewing cDNA microarray technology. We will then focus on one problem
  that arises when processing these images: human error in locating the position of
  the spots can lead to variabilities in the extracted expression levels. We will
  present a Bayesian approach to the image processing which alleviates this problem.
  Our approach makes use of a novel combination of importance sampling and variational
  approximations. Finally if there is time we will briefly show some examples of the
  variational importance sampler applied to visual tracking problems.'
