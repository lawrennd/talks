  In 2014, along with Corinna Cortes, I was Program Chair of the Neural Information Processing Systems conference. At the time, when wondering about innovations for the coference, Corinna and I decided it would be interesting to test the consistency of reviewing. With this in mind, we randomly selected 10% of submissions and had them reviewed by two independent committees. 
  
  In this talk I will review the construction of the experiment, explain how the NeurIPS review process worked and talk about what I felt the implications for reviewing were, vs what the community reaction was.
