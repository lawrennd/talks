:title: Personalized Health with Gaussian Processes
:abstract: Modern data connectivity gives us different views of the patient which
  need to be unified for truly personalized health care. I'll give an personal perspective
  on the type of methodological challenges we expect to arise in this this domain
  and motivate Gaussian process models as one approach to dealing with the explosion
  of data.
