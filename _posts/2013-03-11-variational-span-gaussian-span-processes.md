title: Variational <span>Gaussian</span> Processes
abstract: In this talk we will review the variational approximation to Gaussian processes
  which enables Bayesian learning of latent variables. We will focus in particular
  on a new explanation of the variational approach that also leads to stochastic variational
  inference for GPs.
