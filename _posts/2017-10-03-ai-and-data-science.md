title: "Artificial Intelligence and Data Science" 
abstract: >
  Our current generation of artificial intelligence techniques are driven by data. But also we expect to be able to deploy artificial intelligence techniques on data. What does that mean, is it a contradiction? In this talk I'll give an overview of the landscape and speculate on where artificial intelligence may help address the data deluge.
