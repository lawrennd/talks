title: "Digital Disruption"
subtitle: "Where We Are Now"
abstract: >
  We look towards the future of digital disruption by considering the past of disruption, with a particular focus on the production and movement of goods. 
  
  We introduce the notion of the 'smith', and consider how, by localizing the provision, or supply, a 'smith' can ensure high added value for their skills.
  
  Using analogies from *pull* and *push* supply chains, We argue that our future economy needs to include an environment where a *smiths* prosper. From craft coffee to craft software, to add value in a global marketplace we argue that we need to exploit localization.
