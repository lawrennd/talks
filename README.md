Talks from Neil Lawrence

The talks folder is organized as follows.

Each general subject comes under a sub-directory 

```
_subject/
```

Under that subject, there are a series of talks. Each as a markdown file. These files include various talk files from different parts of the site. They are also allocated to different subject files, under the includes subdirectory.
