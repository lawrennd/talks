title: "Science and the Atomic Human"
abstract: |
  In this talk Neil will reflect on the interaction between science
  and our approach to AI from the particular perspective of his book,
  The Atomic Human.

  Neil will introduce how he sees the human as unique in the context
  of the machine but how some of our science perspectives may have
  undermined our understanding of this uniqueness. Fortunately, the
  possibility of these new forms of automated decision-making, that we
  commonly refer to as "artificial intelligence" also give us a
  scientific "place to stand" and introspect and reflect on who we are
  and what makes us special.
