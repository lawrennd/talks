title: 'Fast Sparse Gaussian Process Methods: The Informative Vector Machine'
abstract: |
  Gaussian processes are a non parametric approach to learning regression
  models. In this talk we will given a brief review of the use of Gaussian
  processes for regression. We will then introduce the informative vector
  machine approach to learning Gaussian processes for Classification on
  large scale data sets. We will show extensions of the method including
  multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning and learning invariances.
