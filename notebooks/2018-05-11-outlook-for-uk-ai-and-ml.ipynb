    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a\n",
    "combination of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{data} + \\text{model} \\xrightarrow{\\text{compute}} \\text{prediction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively\n",
    "acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on\n",
    "previous experience. THat experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through\n",
    "computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To\n",
    "combine data with a model we typically make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a prediction function** a function which is used to make the\n",
    "predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the\n",
    "universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness,\n",
    "spatial similarities, temporal similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**an objective function** a function which defines the cost of\n",
    "misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world's\n",
    "generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for\n",
    "mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of data and model through the prediction function and\n",
    "the objectie function leads to a *learning algorithm*. The class of\n",
    "prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is\n",
    "restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or\n",
    "the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find\n",
    "an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the acdemic field of machine\n",
    "learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring\n",

    "There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our\n",
    "ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information\n",

    "measurement of information from what the information pertains to[^1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the\n",
    "amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin\n",
    "toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the\n",
    "English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English\n",
    "language contains XX bits of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our ability\n",
    "to communicate of around 100 bits per second. Computers on the other\n",
    "hand can communicate much more rapidly. Current wired network speeds are\n",
    "around a billion bits per second, ten million times faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our\n",
    "computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around\n",
    "2 billion floating point operations per second, each floating point\n",
    "operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around\n",
    "120 billion bits per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some\n",
    "estimates the amount of compute we would require to *simulate* a human\n",
    "brain is equivalent to that in the UK's fastest computer, the MET office\n",
    "machine in Exeter, which in 2018 ranks as the 11th fastest computer in\n",
    "the world. That machine simulates the world's weather each morning, and\n",
    "then simulates the world's climate. It is a \\*\\* petaflop machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when it comes to our ability to compute we are extraordinary, not\n",
    "compute in our conscious mind, but the underlying neuron firings that\n",
    "underpin both our consciousness, our sbuconsciousness as well as our\n",
    "motor control etc. By analogy I sometimes like to think of us as a\n",
    "Formula One engine. But in terms of our ability to deploy that\n",
    "computation in actual use, to share the results of what we have\n",
    "inferred, we are very limited. So when you imagine the F1 car that\n",
    "represents a psyche, think of an F1 car with bicycle wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, our computers have less computational power, but they can\n",
    "communicate fare more fluidly. They are more like a go-kart, less well\n",
    "powered, but with tires that allow them to deploy that power.\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, that means much of our computation should be dedicated to\n",
    "considering *what* we should compute. To do that efficiently we need to\n",
    "model the world around us. The most complex thing in the world around us\n",
    "is other humans. So it is no surprise that we model them. We second\n",
    "guess what their intentions are, and our communication is only necessary\n",
    "when they are departing from how we model them. Naturally, for this to\n",
    "work well, we need to understand those we work closely with. So it is no\n",
    "surprise that social communication, social bonding, forms so much of a\n",
    "part of our use of our limited bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second effect here, our need to anthropomorphise objects\n",
    "around us. Our tendency to model our fellow humans extends to when we\n",
    "interact with other entities in our environment. To our pets as well as\n",
    "inanimate objects around us, such as computers or even our cars. This\n",
    "tendency to overinterpret could be a consequence of our limited ability\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../slides/diagrams/data-science/information-flow003.svg\" align=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship\n",
    "between the computer and data. Larege amounts of information can flow\n",
    "between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our\n",
    "relationship with data means that we should consider it an intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Origininally our low bandwith relationship with data was affected by two\n",
    "characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by our\n",
    "need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information\n",
    "channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the\n",
    "domain of *mathematical* statistics and how our cognitive biases can\n",
    "mislead us.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more\n",
    "information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in\n",
    "various ways. If it's motives are not aligned with ours then it can\n",
    "misrepresent the information. This needn't be nefarious it can be simply\n",
    "as a result of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For\n",
    "example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that\n",
    "may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize\n",
    "information in a representative manner in the *shortest* possible lenght\n",
    "of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for me it was a common experience to pick up my telephone\n",
    "with the intention of checking when my next appointme was, but to soon\n",
    "find myself distracted by another application on the phone, and end up\n",
    "reading something on the internet. By the time I'd finished reading, I\n",
    "would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in the first\n",
    "place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can benefit enormously from the very large amount of information we\n",
    "can now obtain through this evolved relationship between us and data.\n",
    "Biology has already benefited from large scale data sharing and the\n",
    "improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by\n",
    "computer. That has underpinned the revolution in computational biology.\n",
    "But in our daily lives this phenomenon is affecting us in ways which we\n",
    "haven't envisaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better mediation of this flow actually requires a better understanding\n",
    "of human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our\n",
    "own intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these\n",
    "might mislead us.\n",

    "emerging field that arises from the fact that we now collect so much\n",
    "data by happenstance, rather than by *experimental design*. Classical\n",
    "statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data, and to do so\n",
    "statistical experiments are carefully designed. In the modern era we\n",
    "collect so much data that there's a desire to draw inferences directly\n",
    "from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from\n",
    "statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data),\n",
    "visualization and data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on\n",
    "emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image,\n",
    "or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent\n",
    "advances in artifcial intelligence have come from machine learning\n",

    "### Three Grades of Data Readiness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate stages\n",
    "of data graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Grade C - accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Grade B - validity\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Grade A - usability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessibility: Grade C\n",
    "\n",
    "The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data science\n",
    "practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who, perhaps\n",
    "having had little experience of data-science before, state that they\n",
    "\"have the data\". More often than not, they have not verified this. A\n",
    "convenient term for this is \"Hearsay Data\", someone has *heard* that\n",
    "they have the data so they *say* they have it. This is the lowest grade\n",
    "of data readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progressing through Grade C involves ensuring that this data is\n",
    "accessible. Not just in terms of digital accessiblity, but also for\n",
    "regulatory, ethical and intellectual property reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity: Grade B\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital analysis\n",
    "on the computer. Once the challenges of access to the data have been\n",
    "resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for direct\n",
    "loading into analysis software (such as Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica\n",
    "or SPSS). Once this has occured the data is at B4 level. Grade B\n",
    "involves the *validity* of the data. Does the data really represent what\n",
    "it purports to? There are challenges such as missing values, outliers,\n",
    "record duplication. Each of these needs to be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade B and C are important as if the work done in these grades is\n",
    "documented well, it can be reused in other projects. Reuse of this\n",
    "labour is key to reducing the costs of data-driven automated decision\n",
    "making. There is a strong overlap between the work required in this\n",
    "grade and the statistical field of [*exploratory data\n",
    "analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)\n",
    "[@Tukey:exploratory77].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usability: Grade A\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the validity of the data is determined, the data set can be\n",
    "considered for use in a particular task. This stage of data readiness is\n",
    "more akin to what machine learning scientists are used to doing in\n",
    "Universities. Bringing an algorithm to bear on a well understood data\n",
    "set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Grade A we are concerned about the utility of the data given a\n",
    "particular task. Grade A may involve additional data collection\n",
    "(experimental design in statistics) to ensure that the task is\n",
    "fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the stage where the data and the model are brought together, so\n",
    "expertise in learning algorithms and their application is key. Further\n",
    "ethical considerations, such as the fairness of the resulting\n",
    "predictions are required at this stage. At the end of this stage a\n",
    "prototype model is ready for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in production is\n",

    "interaction between data scientists and application domain experts.\n",
    "Decisions on data preparation taken outside the context of application\n",
    "have dangerous downstream consequences. This provides an additional\n",
    "burden on the data scientist as they are required for each project, but\n",
    "it should also be seen as a learning and familiarization exercise for\n",
    "the domain expert. Long term, just as biologists have found it necessary\n",
    "to assimilate the skills of the bioinformatician to be effective in\n",
    "their science, most domains will also require a familiarity with the\n",
    "nature of data driven decision making and its application. Working\n",
    "closely with data-scientists on data preparation is one way to begin\n",
    "this sharing of best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processes involved in Grade C and B are often badly taught in\n",
    "courses on data science. Perhaps not due to a lack of interest in the\n",
    "areas, but maybe more due to a lack of access to real world examples\n",
    "where data quality is poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stages of data science are also ridden with ambiguity. In the long\n",

    "responsibilities between pilots and mechanics. Indeed, Rolls Royce\n",

    "\n",
    "Any successful technical innovation has three components. Perhaps the\n",
    "most obvious is that there is technical innovation, but two more are\n",
    "important for innovation to reach its target, whether it's customers,\n",
    "patients or citizens of a country. First of all, the innovation needs to\n",
    "resolve a genuine business, customer or patient problem. That seems\n",
    "clear, but it is the first mistake of many to assume that their novel\n",
    "idea is applicable or somehow must help. Technological solutions have a\n",
    "manner of hypnotising those that develop them. There is a narrative\n",
    "around innovation that is distracting. The second mistake is to innovate\n",
    "to solve a business problem, but not understand the difficulties in\n",
    "deployment. Deployment can be challenging for many reasons whether they\n",
    "are technical or cultural. For example, to successfully deploy an\n",
    "innovation in the NHS it is likely that you need the body of NHS\n",
    "Consultants, Nurses and managers on board. Innovation can not be forced\n",
    "on people. Another challenge is existing ecosystems. I sometimes refer\n",
    "to it as *greenfields* innovation when innovation is taking place in a\n",
    "new ecosystem, but much of the time we are required to do *brownfields*\n",
    "innovation, i.e. innovate in an ecosystem that is already operational.\n",

    "The way we are deploying artificial intelligence systems in practice is\n",
    "to build up systems of machine learning components. To build a machine\n",
    "learning system, we decompose the task into parts which we can emulate\n",
    "with ML methods. Each of these parts can be, typically, independently\n",
    "constructed and verified. For example, in a driverless car we can\n",
    "decompose the tasks into components such as \"pedestrian detection\" and\n",
    "\"road line detection\". Each of these components can be constructed with,\n",
    "for example, an independent classifier. We can then superimpose a logic\n",
    "on top. For example, \"Follow the road line unless you detect a\n",
    "pedestrian in the road\".\n",
    "\n",
