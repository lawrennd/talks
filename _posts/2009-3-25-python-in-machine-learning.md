:abstract: 'Is Python a viable replacement for MATLAB?\\\\ We are incredibly reliant
  on MATLAB, but should we be looking elsewhere for our ML programming needs? In this
  ML lunch I will try and share my recent experiences with Python and machine learning:
  good and bad. The main questions I think we should be considering are:\\\\ Should
  we be trying to move to Python for our research?\\\\ Should we be using Python in
  our teaching?\\\\ I don''t know the answer, but I''ll try and use this MLO lunch
  to start the debate!'
