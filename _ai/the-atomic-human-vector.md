title: "The Atomic Human"
subtitle: "Understanding Ourselves in the Age of AI"
abstract: |
  A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re having
  about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our identity?

  Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
  intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI
  not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the
  implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our
  position at the centre of the world.

  Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
  continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components:
  eventually we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek
  for uncuttable is ‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the
  facets of human intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI
  uncovers what is left: an indivisible core that is the essence of
  humanity.

  I’ll contrast our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence and speculate on what
  it means for our futures.

  This talk is based on Neil’s forthcoming book to be published with
  Allen Lane in June 2024.
