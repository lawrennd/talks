title: The Challenges of Data Science
abstract: 'Data science presents new opportunities but also new challenges. In this
  talk we will focus on three separate challenges for data science: 1. Paradoxes of
  the Data Society, 2. Quantifying the Value of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of control,
  marginalization. Each of these challenges has particular implications for data science.
  By addressing these challenges now we can ensure that the pitfalls of the data driven
  society are overcome allowing to reap the benefits.'
