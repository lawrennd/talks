title: "Artificial Intelligence: Reclaiming Control"
subtitle: “FIT Models must become FIT Systems”
abstract: |
  Though artificial intelligence is ubiquitous in our homes and
  workplaces, there is widespread misunderstanding of what it really
  is. Join us for this public lecture as Neil Lawrence, DeepMind
  Professor of Machine Learning encourages us to reframe our view of
  AI.
 
  He’ll discuss how the artificial systems we have developed operate
  in a fundamentally different way to our own intelligence. He’ll
  describe how this difference in operational capability leads us to
  misunderstand the influence that decisions made by machine
  intelligence are having on our lives. Without this understanding we
  cannot take back control of those decisions from the machine. Along
  the way, he’ll chat with fellow Cambridge University researchers
  about how we maximise the benefits of these technologies while
  minimising the harms.

t’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane. 
 
Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us? 
 
If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.
