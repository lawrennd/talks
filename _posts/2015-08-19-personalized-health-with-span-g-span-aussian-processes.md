title: Personalized Health with <span>G</span>aussian Processes
abstract: Modern data connectivity gives us different views of the patient which need
  to be unified for truly personalized health care. Iâ€™ll give an personal perspective
  on the type of methodological and social challenges we expect to arise in this this
  domain and motivate Gaussian process models as one approach to dealing with the
  explosion of data.
