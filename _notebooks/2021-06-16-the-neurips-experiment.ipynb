    "inconsistency is much less than we would find for a random committee. If\n",
    "we accept that the bias introduced by the Area Chairs knowing when they\n",

    "NIPS 2014 conference with an independent committee then we would expect\n",

    "conference was run at random, then we would only expect 25% of the\n",
    "papers to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s apparent from comments and speculation about what these results\n",
    "mean, that some people might be surprised by the size of this figure.\n",
    "However, it only requires a little thought to see that this figure is\n",
    "likely to be large for any highly selective conference if there is even\n",
    "a small amount of inconsistency in the decision making process. This is\n",
    "because once the conference has chosen to be ‘highly selective’ then\n",
    "because by definition only a small percentage of papers are to be\n",
    "accepted. Now if we think of a type I error as accepting a paper which\n",
    "should be rejected, such errors are easier to make because by definition\n",
    "many more papers should be rejected. Type II errors (rejecting a paper\n",
    "that should be accepted) are less likely becaue (by setting the accept\n",
    "rate low) there are fewer papers that should be accepted in the first\n",
