title: Latent Variable Modelling with Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  In this talk we will briefly describe the Gaussian process latent
  variable model, an approach to probabilistic modelling of data through
  non-linear dimensional reduction. The model takes a dual approach to
  statistical inference and can be shown to generalise PCA. We will
  briefly introduce the model and quickly show some example applications.
venue: Workshop on Probabilistic formulation of the inverse problem and application
  to image reconstruction, Neuroscience Research Institute, University of Manchester,
  U.K.
