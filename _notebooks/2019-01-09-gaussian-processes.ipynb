    "previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through\n",
