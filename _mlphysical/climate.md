  In this lecture we will focus on three areas: 1) monitoring
  environmental change; 2) modelling our climate; and 3) quantifying
  climate risks. The first section will highlight some of the key
  observational datasets available for assessing how our atmosphere
  and oceans have changed over the recent past (from 1900 to the
  present day), and some of the challenges surrounding the non-uniform
  distribution of in-situ measurements. The second section will
  briefly explain what a climate model simulator is, what they are
  good at doing and the challenges associated with comparing their
  output with real-world climate change. Then in the third section we
  will discuss how the climate research community increases spatial
  granularity of our climate models and zoom-in on specific regions of
  interest, such as densely populated regions or vulnerable
  environments. At the end we will go through a Google Colab notebook
  using some gridded climate model simulation output to setup a
  Multifidelity Climate Modelling data challenge!
