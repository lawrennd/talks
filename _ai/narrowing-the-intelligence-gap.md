title: "Narrowing the Intelligence Gap
abstract: >
  How are we making computers do the things we used to associate only with humans? Have we made a breakthrough in understanding human intelligence?
  
  While recent achievements might give the sense that the answer is yes, the short answer is that we are nowhere near. All we’ve achieved for the moment is a breakthrough in emulating intelligence. In this talk we discuss two differences between the artificial intelligence we’ve deployed and the natural intelligence we exhibit. Resolving one is a challenge of changing the way we do systems design, the other, we argue, is a more fundamental difference that may never be overcome.
