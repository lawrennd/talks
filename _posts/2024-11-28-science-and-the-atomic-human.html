title: "Science and the Atomic Human"
venue: "Highgate Literary &amp; Scientific Institution"
abstract: "<p>In this talk Neil will reflect on the interaction between
science and our approach to AI from the particular perspective of his
book, The Atomic Human.</p>
<p>Neil will introduce how he sees the human as unique in the context of
the machine but how some of our science perspectives may have undermined
our understanding of this uniqueness. Fortunately, the possibility of
these new forms of automated decision-making, that we commonly refer to
as “artificial intelligence” also give us a scientific “place to stand”
and introspect and reflect on who we are and what makes us special.</p>"

<p>On 20th May 1932 Amelia Earhart took off in her Lockheed Vega from
Harbour Grace in Canada. She called her plane the ‘Little Red Bus’. She
travelled 2000 miles across open ocean, travelling through a storm,
facing flames from her exhaust manifold, losing her altimeter. Flying
until she sighted the Irish coast, tracking the coast until she saw a
railway and following it until she saw a town, Londonderry. She landed
nearby in a meadow.</p>

<p>The feel of an aircraft is a repeated theme in the early years of
flight. In response to perceived European advances in flight in the
First World War, the US introduced the National Advisory Committee on
Aeronautics. Under the committee a proving ground for aircraft was
formed at Langley Field in Virginia. During the Second World War Bob
Gilruth published a report on the <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930091834">flying qualities
of aircraft</a> that characterised how this feel could be translated
into numbers.</p>

p. 163–168. One of Gilruth’s collaborators suggested that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawker Hurricane airplane. A heavily armed fighter airplane noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane’s flying qualities were
found to be generally satisfactory. The most notable deficiencies were
heavy aileron forces at high speeds and large friction in the
controls.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supermarine Spitfire airplane. A high-performance fighter noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain and throughout WW II, the Spitfire had
desirably light elevator control forces in maneuvers and near neutral
longitudinal stability. Its greatest deficiency from the combat
standpoint was heavy aileron forces and sluggish roll response at high
speeds.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilruth went beyond the reports of feel to characterise how the plane
should respond to different inputs on the control stick. In other words
he quantified that feel of the plane.</p>
<p>Gilrtuth’s work was in the spirit of Lord Kelvin’s quote on
measurement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in
numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in
numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may
be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts
advanced to the stage of science.</p>
<p>From Chapter 3, pg 73 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Thomson-popular89">Thomson (1889)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim was to convert a qualitative property of aircraft into
quantitative measurement, thereby allowing their improvement.</p>

<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>Figure: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn</a> suggests
scientific paradigms are recorded in books.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Kuhn was a historian of science and a philosopher who suggested that
the sociology of science has two principal components to it. His idea is
that “normal science” operates within a paradigm That paradigm is
defined by books which encode our best understanding. An example of a
paradigm is Newtonian mechanics, or another example would be the
geocentric view of the Universe. Within a paradigm normal science
proceeds by scientists solving the “puzzles” that paradigm sets. A
paradigm shift is when the paradigm changes, for example the Corpernican
revolution or the introduction of relativity.</p>
<p>The notion of a paradigm shift has also entered common parlance, this
reflects the idea that wider human knowledge is also shared and stored,
less ormally than scientific knowledge, but still with a dependence on
our information infrastructure.</p>
<p>The digital computer has brought a fundamental change in the nature
of that information infrastructure. By moving information faster the
modern information infrastructure is dominated not by the book, but by
the machine. This brings challenges for managing and controlling this
information infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here, Blake satirises the 17th-century mathematician Isaac Newton.
Portrayed as a muscular youth, Newton seems to be underwater, sitting on
a rock covered with colourful coral and lichen. He crouches over a
diagram, measuring it with a compass. Blake believed that Newton’s
scientific approach to the world was too reductive. Here he implies
Newton is so fixated on his calculations that he is blind to the world
around him. This is one of only 12 large colour prints Blake made. He
seems to have used an experimental hybrid of printing, drawing, and
painting.</p>

<p>Human intelligence is a social intelligence: it is isolated, but it
doesn’t exist in isolation. It sits instead within a broader culture.
The term ‘culture’ originates from the Roman orator Cicero, who wrote of
cultura animi, the cultivation of our minds. He drew an analogy with
agriculture: human knowledge is cultivated similarly to the way crops
are raised from the land: our minds grow and respond to their
intellectual environment.</p>
<p>It is impossible to understand humans without understanding our
context, and human culture is a key part of that context, but the cul-
ture that sustains our minds is also evolving. Over time, how we see
ourselves within the universe has changed. The world looks different to
us today than it did to Michelangelo. Many of these changes have
improved our ability to understand the world around us.</p>

money and water flow. The MONIAC exploits this through a system of
tanks, pipes, valves and floats that represent the flow of money through
the UK economy. Water flowed from the treasury tank at the top of the
model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health
and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support
but was also found to be a useful economic simulator. Several were built
and today you can see the original at Leeds Business School, there is

<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative models, particularly large
language models, have enabled machines that, for the first time, can
converse plausibly with other humans.</p>
<p>The Apollo guidance computer provided Armstrong with an analogy when
he landed it on the Moon. He controlled it through a stick which
provided him with an analogy. The analogy is based in the experience
that Amelia Earhart had when she flew her plane. Armstrong’s control
exploited his experience as a test pilot flying planes that had control
columns which were directly connected to their control surfaces.</p>

<p>In the Sistine Chapel, two panels below Michelangelo’s depiction of
the creation is his rendering of <em>The Fall and Expulsion from
Paradise</em>. Adam and Eve initially exist in Eden; their lives are
entirely managed for them. They are warned not to eat from the tree of
knowledge. When they do so they become self-aware and are expelled from
the garden.</p>
<p>Michelangelo’s picture depicts the pain of this expulsuion, the idea
that they will now be subjected to the miseries of the world outside –
disease and suffering. But the story can also be viewed as a
transformation from beings who are fully subject to God’s will to beings
who determine their own future. Under this view, the fall is actually a
moment of creation. Creation of beings with free will.</p>

<p>One of the promises of artificial intelligence is that by increasing
its involvement in our lives it will be able to cater for our needs. By
giving the machine more access to our data, the idea is that it will be
able to alleviate that suffering and cure our diseases – the machine
will look after us. In the western tradition the forbidden fruit is an
apple, and in today’s world it could be our Apple computers that guide
us back into the walled garden of Eden. Already our Apple watches can
monitor our heart rates and inform us of the number of steps we need to
take to maintain our health. But as we cede control to the machine, we
are also losing what Adam and Eve gained by eating from the tree. We
lose personal responsibility and freedom of choice. The Garden of Eden
is depicted as a benevolent autocracy, but such an autocracy necessarily
limits the freedoms of the indi- viduals within it. There is no
one-size-fits-all set of values. Each of us will react differently to
whether this price is worth the outcome, and our ideas will change over
time. How much we each want to be constrained by a benevolent overseer
may differ when we are faced with severe illness rather than being
youthful and healthy. If we respect the dignity of the individual human,
we need to accommodate this diversity of perspectives.</p>
<p>But we need to be active in our protection of individual dignity if
we don’t want to sleep walk back into an implicit autocracy managed
through the reflected understanding that is stored in the HAMs.</p>

<p>Blake’s vision of the creation of man, known as Elohim Creating Adam,
is a strong contrast to Michelangelo’s. The faces of both God and Adam
show deep anguish. The image is closer to representations of Prometheus
receiving his punishment for sharing his knowledge of fire than to the
languid ecstasy we see in Michelangelo’s representation.</p>

<p>The caption in the Tate reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elohim is a Hebrew name for God. This picture illustrates the Book of
Genesis: ‘And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground’. Adam
is shown growing out of the earth, a piece of which Elohim holds in his
left hand.</p>
<p>For Blake the God of the Old Testament was a false god. He believed
the Fall of Man took place not in the Garden of Eden, but at the time of
creation shown here, when man was dragged from the spiritual realm and
made material.</p>
