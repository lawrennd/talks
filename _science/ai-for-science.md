title: "AI for Science: An Oral Report from a Recent Dagstuhl Workshop"
abstract: >
  As part of the Accelerate Science programme with Jess Montgomery, the University of Tuebingen, the University of Wisconsin, and NYU we recently hosted a week-long programme at the Leibniz-Zentrum f√ºr Informatik in Dagstuhl, Germany. In this talk Neil will give an oral report on the discussions sharing some of the ideas presented at the meeting. The ideas will feed into a longer report on the area produced by the Accelerate Science team.
