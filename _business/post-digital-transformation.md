title: "Post Digital Transformation"
subtitle: "Data First Culture and the AI Revolution"
abstract: >
  Artificial intelligence promises automated decision making that will alleviate and revolutionise the nature of work. In practice, we know from previous technological solutions, new technologies often take time to percolate through to productivity. Robert Solow’s paradox saw “computers everywhere, except in the productivity statistics”. This session will equip attendees with an understanding of how to establish best practices around automated decision making. In particular, we will focus on the raw material of the AI revolution: the data.
