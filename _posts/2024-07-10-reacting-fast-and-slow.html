abstract: "<p>What is fundamental to our intelligence? In this talk
building on the ideas in <em>The Atomic Human</em> I argue that the
external world is key to our intelligence, and how that world is
filtered before we perceive it. This leads to the Eisenhower illusion,
where we feel ourselves in charge but we are in fact reliant on fast
reacting systems.</p>"

<p>On 20th May 1932 Amelia Earhart took off in her Lockheed Vega from
Harbour Grace in Canada. She called her plane the ‘Little Red Bus’. She
travelled 2000 miles across open ocean, travelling through a storm,
facing flames from her exhaust manifold, losing her altimeter. Flying
until she sighted the Irish coast, tracking the coast until she saw a
railway and following it until she saw a town, Londonderry. She landed
nearby in a meadow.</p>

<p>The feel of an aircraft is a repeated theme in the early years of
flight. In response to perceived European advances in flight in the
First World War, the US introduced the National Advisory Committee on
Aeronautics. Under the committee a proving ground for aircraft was
formed at Langley Field in Virginia. During the Second World War Bob
Gilruth published a report on the <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930091834">flying qualities
of aircraft</a> that characterised how this feel could be translated
into numbers.</p>

p. 163–168. One of Gilruth’s collaborators suggested that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawker Hurricane airplane. A heavily armed fighter airplane noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane’s flying qualities were
found to be generally satisfactory. The most notable deficiencies were
heavy aileron forces at high speeds and large friction in the
controls.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supermarine Spitfire airplane. A high-performance fighter noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain and throughout WW II, the Spitfire had
desirably light elevator control forces in maneuvers and near neutral
longitudinal stability. Its greatest deficiency from the combat
standpoint was heavy aileron forces and sluggish roll response at high
speeds.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilruth went beyond the reports of feel to characterise how the plane
should respond to different inputs on the control stick. In other words
he quantified that feel of the plane.</p>
<p>Gilrtuth’s work was in the spirit of Lord Kelvin’s quote on
measurement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in
numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in
numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may
be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts
advanced to the stage of science.</p>
<p>From Chapter 3, pg 73 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Thomson-popular89">Thomson (1889)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim was to convert a qualitative property of aircraft into
quantitative measurement, thereby allowing their improvement.</p>

</div>
<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

</div>
</div>
<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the

</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Blake’s vision of the creation of man, known as Elohim Creating Adam,
is a strong contrast to Michelangelo’s. The faces of both God and Adam
show deep anguish. The image is closer to representations of Prometheus

<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative models, particularly large
language models, have enabled machines that, for the first time, can
converse plausibly with other humans.</p>
<p>The Apollo guidance computer provided Armstrong with an analogy when
he landed it on the Moon. He controlled it through a stick which
provided him with an analogy. The analogy is based in the experience
that Amelia Earhart had when she flew her plane. Armstrong’s control
exploited his experience as a test pilot flying planes that had control
columns which were directly connected to their control surfaces.</p>

<p>The generative systems we have produced do not provide us with the
“AI” of science fiction. Because their intelligence is based on
emulating human knowledge. Through being forced to reproduce our
literature and our art they have developed aspects which are analogous
to the cultural proxy truths we use to describe our world.</p>
<p>These machines are to humans what the MONIAC was the British economy.
Not a replacement, but an analogue computer that captures some aspects
of humanity while providing advantages of high bandwidth of the
machine.</p>

<p>The Human-Analogue Machine or HAM therefore provides a route through
which we could better understand our world through improving the way we
interact with machines.</p>

modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction
of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the
computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the

<p>Of course this route provides new routes for manipulation, new ways
in which the machine can undermine our autonomy or exploit our cognitive
foibles. The major challenge we face is steering between these worlds
where we gain the advantage of the computer’s bandwidth without
undermining our culture and individual autonomy.</p>

<p>Even if we calibrate these tools correctly so that they do represent
the world appropriately we are at risk. The hippocampus is part of our
brain’s cortex, oOne role of our hippocampus is in navigation, knowing
how to move from one place to another.</p>

<p>By becoming overreliant on HAMs and there interface to the digital
computer are we at risk of suffering from the same deskilling we
perceive in our navigational skills? Does this place us at risk of
sleepwalking into a world that is managed by the machine even as we
believe that we are managing it ourselves?</p>
