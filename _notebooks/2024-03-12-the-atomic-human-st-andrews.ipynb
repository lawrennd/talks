AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.\n",

    "This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.\n",

    "Let’s take a step back from artificial intelligence, and consider\n",
    "natural intelligence. Or even more generally, let’s consider the\n",
    "contrast between an artificial *system* and an natural system. The key\n",
    "difference between the two is that artificial systems are *designed*\n",
    "whereas natural systems are *evolved*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems design is a major component of all Engineering disciplines. The\n",
    "details differ, but there is a single common theme: achieve your\n",
    "objective with the minimal use of resources to do the job. That provides\n",
    "efficiency. The engineering designer imagines a solution that requires\n",
    "the minimal set of components to achieve the result. A water pump has\n",
    "one route through the pump. That minimises the number of components\n",
    "needed. Redundancy is introduced only in safety critical systems, such\n",
    "as aircraft control systems. Students of biology, however, will be aware\n",
    "that in nature system-redundancy is everywhere. Redundancy leads to\n",
    "robustness. For an organism to survive in an evolving environment it\n",
    "must first be robust, then it can consider how to be efficient. Indeed,\n",
    "organisms that evolve to be too efficient at a particular task, like\n",
    "those that occupy a niche environment, are particularly vulnerable to\n",
    "extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion is akin to the idea that only the best will survive,\n",
    "popularly encoded into an notion of evolution by Herbert Spencer’s\n",
    "quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Survival of the fittest\n",
    ">\n",
    "> [Herbet Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer), 1864\n",
    "\n",
    "Darwin himself never said “Survival of the Fittest” he talked about\n",
    "evolution by natural selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Non-survival of the non-fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution is better described as “non-survival of the non-fit”. You\n",
    "don’t have to be the fittest to survive, you just need to avoid the\n",
    "pitfalls of life. This is the first priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is with natural vs artificial intelligences. Any natural\n",
    "intelligence that was not robust to changes in its external environment\n",
    "would not survive, and therefore not reproduce. In contrast the\n",
    "artificial intelligences we produce are designed to be efficient at one\n",
    "specific task: control, computation, playing chess. They are *fragile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule of a natural system is not be intelligent, it is “don’t\n",
    "be stupid”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mistake we make in the design of our systems is to equate fitness with\n",
    "the objective function, and to assume it is known and static. In\n",
    "practice, a real environment would have an evolving fitness function\n",
    "which would be unknown at any given time.\n",

    "Intelligence](http://inverseprobability.com/2018/02/06/natural-and-artificial-intelligence)..\n",

    "The first criterion of a natural intelligence is *don’t fail*, not\n",
    "because it has a will or intent of its own, but because if it had failed\n",
    "it wouldn’t have stood the test of time. It would no longer exist. In\n",
    "contrast, the mantra for artificial systems is to be more efficient. Our\n",

    "The systems we produce today only work well when their tasks are\n",
    "pigeonholed, bounded in their scope. To achieve robust artificial\n",
    "intelligences we need new approaches to both the design of the\n",

    "to achieve robust intelligences.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even if we find technological solutions for these challenges,\n",
    "it may be that the essence of human intelligence remains out of reach.\n",
    "It may be that the most quintessential element of our intelligence is\n",
    "defined by limitations. Limitations that computers have never\n",
    "experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Shannon developed the idea of information theory: the mathematics\n",
    "of information. He defined the amount of information we gain when we\n",
    "learn the result of a coin toss as a “bit” of information. A typical\n",
    "computer can communicate with another computer with a billion bits of\n",
    "information per second. Equivalent to a billion coin tosses per second.\n",
    "So how does this compare to us? Well, we can also estimate the amount of\n",
    "information in the English language. Shannon estimated that the average\n",
    "English word contains around 12 bits of information, twelve coin tosses,\n",
    "this means our verbal communication rates are only around the order of\n",
    "tens to hundreds of bits per second. Computers communicate tens of\n",
    "millions of times faster than us, in relative terms we are constrained\n",
    "to a bit of pocket money, while computers are corporate billionaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intelligence is not an island, it interacts, it infers the goals or\n",
    "intent of others, it predicts our own actions and how we will respond to\n",
    "others. We are social animals, and together we form a communal\n",
    "intelligence that characterises our species. For intelligence to be\n",
    "communal, our ideas to be shared somehow. We need to overcome this\n",
    "bandwidth limitation. The ability to share and collaborate, despite such\n",
    "constrained ability to communicate, characterises us. We must\n",
    "intellectually commune with one another. We cannot communicate all of\n",
    "what we saw, or the details of how we are about to react. Instead, we\n",
    "need a shared understanding. One that allows us to infer each other’s\n",
    "intent through context and a common sense of humanity. This\n",
    "characteristic is so strong that we anthropomorphise any object with\n",
    "which we interact. We apply moods to our cars, our cats, our\n",
    "environment. We seed the weather, volcanoes, trees with intent. Our\n",
    "desire to communicate renders us intellectually animist.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our limited bandwidth doesn’t constrain us in our imaginations. Our\n",
    "consciousness, our sense of self, allows us to play out different\n",

    "learn from an internal simulation of the wider world. Empathy allows us\n",
    "to understand others’ likely responses without having the full detail of\n",
    "their mental state. We can infer their perspective. Self-awareness also\n",
    "allows us to understand our own likely future responses, to look forward\n",
    "in time, play out a scenario. Our brains contain a sense of self and a\n",
    "sense of others. Because our communication cannot be complete it is both\n",
    "contextual and cultural. When driving a car in the UK a flash of the\n",
    "lights at a junction concedes the right of way and invites another road\n",
    "user to proceed, whereas in Italy, the same flash asserts the right of\n",
    "way and warns another road user to remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main intelligence is our social intelligence, intelligence that is\n",
    "dedicated to overcoming our bandwidth limitation. We are individually\n",
    "complex, but as a society we rely on shared behaviours and\n",
    "oversimplification of our selves to remain coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This nugget of our intelligence seems impossible for a computer to\n",
    "recreate directly, because it is a consequence of our evolutionary\n",
    "history. The computer, on the other hand, was born into a world of data,\n",
    "of high bandwidth communication. It was not there through the genesis of\n",
    "our minds and the cognitive compromises we made are lost to time. To be\n",
    "a truly human intelligence you need to have shared that journey with us.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?\n",
    "How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with\n",
    "unreliable data and *unreliable statistics*. The misrepresentations this\n",
    "leads to are worse than the absence of data as they give a false sense\n",
    "of confidence to decision making. Understanding how to avoid these\n",
    "pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its value, one that\n",

    "If you want to complete a task, should you do it now or should you put\n",
    "it off until tomorrow? Despite being told to not delay tasks, many of us\n",
    "are deadline driven. Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kappenball is a simple game that illustrates that this behaviour can be\n",
    "optimal. It is inspired by an example in stochastic optimal control by\n",
    "[Bert Kappen](https://www.snn.ru.nl/~bertk/). The game is as follows:\n",
    "you need to place a falling balloon into one of two holes, but if the\n",
    "balloon misses the holes it will pop on pins placed in the ground. In\n",
    "‘deterministic mode’, the balloon falls straight towards the ground and\n",
    "the game is easy. You simply choose which hole to place the ball in, and\n",
    "you can start to place it there as soon as the ball appears at the top\n",
    "of the screen. The game becomes more interesting as you increase the\n",
    "uncertainty. In Kappenball, the uncertainty takes the form of the\n",
    "balloon being blown left and right as it falls. This movement means that\n",
    "it is not sensible to decide early on which hole to place the balloon\n",
    "in. A better strategy is to wait and see which hole the ball falls\n",
    "towards. You can then place it in that hole using less energy than in\n",
    "deterministic mode. Sometimes, the ball even falls into the hole on its\n",
    "own, and you don’t have to expend any energy, but it requires some skill\n",
    "to judge when you need to intervene. For this system Bert Kappen has\n",
    "shown mathematically that the best solution is to wait until the ball is\n",
    "close to the hole before you push it in. In other words, you should be\n",
    "deadline driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it seems here uncertainty is a good thing, because on average\n",
    "you’ll get the ball into the hole with less energy (by playing\n",
    "intelligently, and being deadline driven!) than you do with\n",
    "\\`deterministic mode’. It requires some skill to do this, more than the\n",
    "deterministic system, but by using your resources intelligently you can\n",
    "get more out of the system. However, if the uncertainty increases too\n",
    "much then regardless of your skill, you can’t control the ball at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple game explains many of the behaviours we exhibit in real\n",
    "life. If a system is completely deterministic, then we can make a\n",
    "decision early on and be sure that the ball will ‘drop in the hole’.\n",
    "However, if there is uncertainty in a system, it can make sense to delay\n",
    "our decision making until we’ve seen how events ‘pan out’. Be careful\n",
    "though, as we also see that when the uncertainty is large, if you don’t\n",
    "have the resources or the skill to be deadline-driven the uncertainty\n",
    "can overwhelm you and events can quickly move beyond our control."
