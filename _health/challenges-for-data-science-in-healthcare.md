### Background: Big Data {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* The pervasiveness of data brings forward particular challenges.

* Those challenges are most sharply in focus for personalized health.

* Particular opportunities, in challenging areas such as *mental health*.

### Evolved Relationship {.slide: data-transition="none"}

\includesvg{../slides/diagrams/data-science/information-flow003.svg}


### Effects {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.

* Great *promise* for personalized health.

### Societal Effects {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.

* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data.

* Particularly important where treatments are being prescribed.

* But what is a treatment in the modern era: interventions could be far more subtle.

### Societal Effects {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer

* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science


### Challenges {.slide: data-transition="none"}

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization

### Also need {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* More classical statistics!
    * Like the 'paperless office'

* A better characterization of human (see later)

* Larger studies (100,000 genome)
    * Combined with complex models: algorithmic challenges

### Conclusion {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* Data science offers a great deal of promise for healthcare
* There are challenges and pitfalls

**Many solutions rely on changes to our culture of healthcare**
