title: "Machine Learning: A Revolution in Computer Science?"
abstract: >
  Machine learning technologies have underpinned the recent upsurge in
  interest in artificial intelligence. They introduce decision making
  driven by data.

  One facet that seems to have escaped us unnoticed is their
  transgression of the data/code boundary which has hitherto been
  sacrosanct in computer science. In this talk I argue that the next
  wave of development in artificial intelligence technologies will not
  be through individual machine learning algorithms, but by revisiting
  how we deliver computer science technologies in the light of this
  change.
