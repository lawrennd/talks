title: Gaussian Processes
abstract: >
  Classical machine learning and statistical approaches to learning, such as neural networks and linear regression, assume a parametric form for functions. Gaussian process models are an alternative approach that assumes a probabilistic prior over functions. This brings benefits, in that uncertainty of function estimation is sustained throughout inference, and some challenges: algorithms for fitting Gaussian processes tend to be more complex than parametric models. 
  
  In this sessions I will introduce Gaussian processes and explain why sustaining uncertainty is important.
