title: Policy, Science and the Convening Power of Data
abstract: |
  With the world watching case numbers increase and publics and
  policymakers scrutinising projections from epidemiological models,
  the covid-19 pandemic brought with it increased attention on the use
  of data to inform policy. Alongside this scrutiny came a new wave of
  interest in the ability of data and artificial intelligence (AI) to
  help tackle major scientific and social challenges: could our
  increasing ability to collect, combine and interrogate large
  datasets lead to new insights that unlock more effective policy
  responses? Experiences from the DELVE Initiative, convened to bring
  data science to bear on covid-19 policy, suggests achieving this aim
  requires wider adoption of open data science methods to deploy data
  science and AI expertise and resources to tackle real-world
  problems.

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}$$


\notes{Any policy question can be framed in a number of different ways  - what are the health outcomes; what is the impact on NHS capacity; how are different groups affected; what is the economic impact – and each has different types of evidence associated with it. Complex and uncertain challenges require efforts to draw insights together from across disciplines.}

\notes{Sustained engagement between government and academia plays an important role in building mutual understanding about what each can deliver. Core to Delve’s work was the intention that research questions be framed in ways that would resonate with the policy challenges being seen in government.}

\section{Supply Chain of Ideas}

\notes{The main philosphy of the group is to follow the ["Supply Chain of Ideas"](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/coconut-science-and-the-supply-chain-of-ideas.html).}

\notes{There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]}
