<p>Figure: The Atomic Eye, by slicing away aspects of the human that we

<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

<p>How could he do that? Well, first, they set up a mechanism where he
could scan across letters and blink at the letter he wanted to use. In
this way, he was able to write each letter.</p>
<p>It took him 10 months of four hours a day to write the book. Each

<p>Imagine doing all that thinking, but so little speaking, having all

<p>One challenge for the atomic human is that we are all in that

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of
explanation that come with AI is Intellectual Debt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan
Zittrain has coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">“Intellectual
Debt”</a> to describe the challenge of understanding what you’ve
created. In <a
href="https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/data-oriented-architectures-for-ai-based-systems.html">the
ML@CL group we’ve been foucssing on developing the notion of a
<em>data-oriented architecture</em></a> to deal with intellectual debt
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cabrera-realworld23">(Cabrera et al.,
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability
of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine
learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and
transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if
we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe
this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining
regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”.
Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it
feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual,
because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation
task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting
individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can
linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual
tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore
fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>

<p>In computer systems the concept of <em>technical debt</em> has been

</div>
<p>To construct such complex systems an approach known as “separation of
concerns” has been developed. The idea is that you architect your
system, which consists of a large-scale complex task, into a set of
simpler tasks. Each of these tasks is separately implemented. This is
known as the decomposition of the task.</p>
<p>This is where Jonathan Zittrain’s beautifully named term
“intellectual debt” rises to the fore. Separation of concerns enables
the construction of a complex system. But who is concerned with the
overall system?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical debt is the inability to <em>maintain</em> your complex
software system.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual debt is the inability to <em>explain</em> your
software system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is right there in our approach to software engineering.
“Separation of concerns” means no one is concerned about the overall
system itself.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

<p>In the UK we saw these effects play out in the Horizon scandal: the
accounting system of the national postal service was computerized by
Fujitsu and first installed in 1999, but neither the Post Office nor
Fujitsu were able to control the system they had deployed. When it went
wrong individual sub postmasters were blamed for the systems’ errors.
Over the next two decades they were prosecuted and jailed leaving lives
ruined in the wake of the machine’s mistakes.</p>

<p>Figure: A young sorcerer learns his masters spells, and deploys them
to perform his chores, but can’t control the result.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Goethe’s poem The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a young sorcerer learns
one of their master’s spells and deploys it to assist in his chores.
Unfortunately, he cannot control it. The poem was popularised by Paul
Dukas’s musical composition, in 1940 Disney used the composition in the
film Fantasia. Mickey Mouse plays the role of the hapless apprentice who
deploys the spell but cannot control the results.</p>
<p>When it comes to our software systems, the same thing is happening.
The Harvard Law professor, Jonathan Zittrain <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">calls
the phenomenon intellectual debt</a>. In intellectual debt, like the
sorcerer’s apprentice, a software system is created but it cannot be
explained or controlled by its creator. The phenomenon comes from the
difficulty of building and maintaining large software systems: the
complexity of the whole is too much for any individual to understand, so
it is decomposed into parts. Each part is constructed by a smaller team.
The approach is known as separation of concerns, but it has the
unfortunate side effect that no individual understands how the whole
system works. When this goes wrong, the effects can be devastating. We
saw this in the recent Horizon scandal, where neither the Post Office or
Fujitsu were able to control the accounting system they had deployed,
and we saw it when Facebook’s systems were manipulated to spread
misinformation in the 2016 US election.</p>
<p>In 2019 Mark Zuckerberg <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html">wrote
an op-ed in the Washington Post</a> calling for regulation of social
media. He was repeating the realisation of Goethe’s apprentice, he had
released a technology he couldn’t control. In Goethe’s poem, the master
returns, “Besen, besen! Seid’s gewesen” he calls, and order is restored,
but back in the real world the role of the master is played by Popper’s
open society. Unfortunately, those institutions have been undermined by
the very spell that these modern apprentices have cast. The book, the
letter, the ledger, each of these has been supplanted in our modern
information infrastructure by the computer. The modern scribes are
software engineers, and their guilds are the big tech companies.
Facebook’s motto was to “move fast and break things”. Their software
engineers have done precisely that and the apprentice has robbed the
master of his powers. This is a desperate situation, and it’s getting
worse. The latest to reprise the apprentice’s role are Sam Altman and
OpenAI who dream of “general intelligence” solutions to societal
problems which OpenAI will develop, deploy, and control. Popper worried
about the threat of totalitarianism to our open societies, today’s
threat is a form of information totalitarianism which emerges from the
way these companies undermine our institutions.</p>
<p>So, what to do? If we value the open society, we must expose these
modern apprentices to scrutiny. Open development processes are critical
here, Fujitsu would never have got away with their claims of system
robustness for Horizon if the software they were using was open source.
We also need to re-empower the professions, equipping them with the
resources they need to have a critical understanding of these
technologies. That involves redesigning the interface between these
systems and the humans that empowers civil administrators to query how
they are functioning. This is a mammoth task. But recent technological
developments, such as code generation from large language models, offer
a route to delivery.</p>
<p>The open society is characterised by institutions that collaborate
with each otherin the pragmatic pursuit of solutions to social problems.
The large tech companies that have thrived because of the open society
are now putting that ecosystem in peril. For the open society to survive
it needs to embrace open development practices that enable Popper’s
piecemeal social engineers to come back together and chant “Besen,
besen! Seid’s gewesen.” Before it is too late for the master to step in
and deal with the mess the apprentice has made.</p>

Open Society and Its Enemies by Karl Popper</a> views liberal
democracies as a collection of “piecemeal social engineers” who strive
towards better outcomes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Popper opened the preface to his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="Popper-open45">(Popper, 1945)</span> with the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to
belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to
great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to
show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial
attack on freedom and reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had written the book against the background of the second world
war, his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria
in March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For Popper, the ideas of “great men” become totalitarian when imposed
on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form
of government that can allow for institutional change without bloodshed.
The open society is one characterized by institutions and individuals
that can engage in the practical pursuit of solutions to social and
political problems. The institutions are also underpinned by
individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil administrators and many more.
To Popper it is these “piecemeal social engineers” who offer pragmatic
solutions to our society’s political and social challenges.</p>

<p>Figure: <a

scientific paradigms are recorded in books.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Kuhn was a historian of science and a philosopher who suggested that
the sociology of science has two principal components to it. His idea is
that “normal science” operates within a paradigm That paradigm is
defined by books which encode our best understanding. An example of a
paradigm is Newtonian mechanics, or another example would be the
geocentric view of the Universe. Within a paradigm normal science
proceeds by scientists solving the “puzzles” that paradigm sets. A
paradigm shift is when the paradigm changes, for example the Corpernican
revolution or the introduction of relativity.</p>
<p>The notion of a paradigm shift has also entered common parlance, this
reflects the idea that wider human knowledge is also shared and stored,
less ormally than scientific knowledge, but still with a dependence on
our information infrastructure.</p>
<p>The digital computer has brought a fundamental change in the nature
of that information infrastructure. By moving information faster the
modern information infrastructure is dominated not by the book, but by
the machine. This brings challenges for managing and controlling this
information infrastructure.</p>

model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health
and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>While it appears that Generative AI is the revolution, really it is
just the latest manifestation of the information revolution. The effect
where we are now dominated by the computer in its information processing
capabilities.</p>
<p>These new capabilities offer both benefits and pitfalls in terms of
how they will steer the information revolution. Danger that these
solutions are being designed centrally for the convenience of the
developer not the depployer.</p>
<p>Devolved autonomy presents a difficult balance with individual’s
contextual awareness being important in robust decision making and for
consequential desisions human-in-the-loop remaining vital. (See case
studies)</p>
<p>Danger for businesses in losing the notion of intelligent
accountability which renders the human value of their business a
function of their processes.</p>
