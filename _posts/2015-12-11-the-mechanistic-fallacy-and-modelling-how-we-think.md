title: The Mechanistic Fallacy and Modelling How We Think
abstract: In this talk we will discuss how our current set of modelling solutions
  relates to dual process models from psychology. By analogising with layered models
  of networks we first address the danger of focussing purely on mechanism (or biological
  plausibility) when discussion modelling in the brain. We term this idea the mechanistic
  fallacy. In an attempt to operate at a higher level of abstraction, we then take
  a conceptual approach and attempt to map the broader domain of mechanistic and phenomological
  models to dual process ideas from psychology. it seems that System 1 is closer to
  phenomological and System 2 is closer to mechanistic ideas. We will draw connections
  to surrogate modelling (also known as emmulation) and speculate that one role of
  System 2 may be to provide additional simulation data for System 1.
