abstract: Artificial intelligence offers great promise, but we must ensure it does not deepen inequalities.  In this provocation we will argue that AI hasn't delivered on what society has asked of it, but it new technologies mean it could do.
venue: "Digitalisation and AI for public value"
transition: None

\notes{In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy. One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution. Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an elixir to resolve society’s problems.

In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across society.

When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.}
