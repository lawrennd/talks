\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}

\notes{One of the struggles of artificial intelligence is that the term means different things to different people. Our intelligence is precious to us, and the notion that it can be easily recreated is disturbing to us. This leads to some dystopian notions of artificial intelligence, such as the singularity.}

\notes{Depending on whether this powerful technology is viewed as beneficent or maleficent, it can be viewed either as a helpful assistant, in the manner of Jeeves, or a tyrannical dictator.}

\include{_ai/includes/ai-as-manservant.md}

\notes{The history of automation and technology is a history of us adapting to technological change. The invention of the railways, and the need for consistent national times to timetable our movements. The development of the factory system in the mills of Derbyshire required workers to operate and maintain the machines that replaced them.}

> Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply PAGE 185a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.

\speakernotes{I have a great dislike for Russell; I cannot explain it completely, but I feel a detestation for the man. As far as any sympathy with me, or with anyone else, I believe, he is an iceberg. His mind impresses one as a keen, cold, narrow logical machine, that cuts the universe into neat little packets, that measure, as it were, just three inches each way. His type of mathematical analysis he applies as a sort of Procrustean bed to the facts, and those that contain more than his system provides for, he lops short, and those that contain less, he draws out.

Jean Dominique Bauby suffered from locked-in syndrome. The embodiment factors show that relative to the machine we are also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of time it would take to communicate one second's worth of computation. For computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, whether locked in or not, it is a matter of many millions of years.}{embodiment-factors-table}}

\notes{Introduce Lee Seedol (seedolian voids)

\notes{AlphaGo won the challenge match 4-1, the neural networks had found
feature landscape which allowed good decisions to be made in the game,
and another major frontier for AI was overcome. But despite the tens of
millions of games AlphaGo had played, despite the additional work of Fan
Hui training Alpha Go, despite the millions of dollars spent on compute
and the hundreds of scientists working for DeepMind, Lee Sedol still
managed to win a game. Given the effort stacked against him, it was a
breathtaking achievement.

Despite the many millions of matches that AlphaGo had played, Lee Sedol
managed to find a board position that was distinct from anything AlphaGo
had seen before. Within the high dimensional pinball machine that made
up AlphaGo's decision making systems, Lee Sedol found a niche, an
Achillean chink in AlphaGo's armour. He found a path through the neural
network where no data had every been before. He found a location in
feature space where there be dragons.

\notes{Yes, something like that is a good idea. I'm going to start a small document.

22nd sounds sensible.

I think bringing together the Accelerate, Turing and McGovern work could be interesting. Putting together under a theme … maybe that is supply chain of ideas. But need to relate that to passage of information and perhaps the role for ML in society??

How about I send out an invite for the afternoon of 22 January? (Give you a week or so of adjusting to term starting, but 3 weeks to make changes before the event?)
 
Also happy to kick around ideas before that, if useful. Feels like you could tie together intellectual debt and supply chain of ideas (what happens when you speed up the pace of coconut production?) and the characteristics you need for AI systems to work well with people.

Yes, good idea. 
 
Let's get a target date for the test run in (I'm still not 100% sure what to talk about!)

Oooo! I was thinking about this the other day – we could do a test run on this with the group. Sort of a dress rehearsal, if you want to try out different lines or ideas? But also a way of contributing to the process of introducing ML@CL and Accelerate to each other.

Hi Neil, 
 
We have a new initiative here at the university AI4Research where the focus is on developing AI/ML and in particular the use of AI/ML at a tool to develop other disciplines (medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.). Some background on the project is available here https://uu.se/en/research/ai4research/  and when I was asked to write about the ideas it resulted in this
https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/news/article/?id=14730&typ=artikel&lang=en
 
If you like these ideas and have a story that somehow aligns with this that would be great. However, I definitely do not want to force you into talking about this topic, I only mentioning it since you asked for some concrete ideas.
 
In any case, it is important that your talk is broadly accessible to a wide audience (Technology and Natural Science) at the same time as it remains scientific, which is of course the challenge with talks of this kind. 
 
Hope this can be of some help?
 
Best,
Thomas

It would be great to have a sense of what you'd prefer me to talk about. I can imagine a few different things, but if I have a good steer from yourself, I'd be happy to use that!

Hi Neil,
 
Just let me know if you want to discuss title, abstract or anything else related to your talk at this stage.
 
Cheers,
