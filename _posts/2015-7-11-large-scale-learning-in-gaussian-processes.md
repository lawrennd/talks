title: Large Scale Learning in Gaussian Processes
abstract: 'Gaussian process models view the kernel matrix as representing the covariance
  between data points. In a Gaussian process, the RKHS function is a mean of a posterior
  distribution over possible functions. Gaussian processes sustain uncertainty around
  this means and this leads to a posterior *covariance* function (or kernel) associated
  with the process. A complication for large scale Gaussian process models is the
  need to sustain the estimate for this covariance function. In this talk we''ll review
  how this can be done probabilistically through a variational approach we know as
  ''variational compression''. '
