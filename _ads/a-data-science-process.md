  In this lecture we introduce a data science process: access, assess and address. The process Given the landscape we've outlined, in this lecture we will look at the challenges of deploying data science solutions in practice. We categorize them into three groups.

\notes{There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]}

\notes{Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key question. To facilitate this, we also used ideas from \addblog{open data science}{2014/07/01/open-data-science} to facilitate communication and understanding.}
