### Background: Big Data

* Data is Pervasive phenomenon that affects all aspects of our activities

* Data diffusiveness is both a challenge and an opportunity

### Evolved Relationship

### Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.


### Societal Effects

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.

* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data.

### Societal Effects

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer

* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science


### Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization

### Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**
