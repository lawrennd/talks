abstract: In biochemical interaction networks is a key problem in estimation of the
  structure and parameters of the genetic, metabolic and protein interaction networks
  that underpin all biological processes. We present a framework for Bayesian marginalisation
  of these latent chemical species through Gaussian process priors. We demonstrate
  our general approach on three different biological examples of single input motifs,
  including both activation and repression of transcription. We focus in particular
  on the problem of inferring transcription factor activity when the concentration
  of active protein cannot easily be measured. The uncertainty in the inferred transcription
  factor activity can be integrated out in order to derive a likelihood function that
  can be used for the estimation of regulatory model parameters.
