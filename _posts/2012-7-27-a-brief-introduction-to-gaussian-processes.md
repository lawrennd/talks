title: A Brief Introduction to Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  Gaussian processes are non-parametric probabilistic models for function
  representation. In this tutorial we give a brief introduction to
  Gaussian process models. Using simple examples we show how, with
  particular choices for covariance functions (analagous to a kernel
  matrix in kernel methods), we can perform inference about functions
  using only data sampled from those functions. We give overview how the
  probabilistic interpretation allows us to fit the parameters of the
  covariance function.
