    "The machine learning approach to artificial intelligence is to collect\n",

    "by input data (e.g. a particular image) and a label (e.g. is there a car\n",
    "in the image yes/no). The machine learning algorithm fits a mathematical\n",
    "function (I call this the *prediction function*) to map from the input\n",
    "image to the label. The parameters of the prediction function are set by\n",
    "minimizing an error between the function’s predictions and the true\n",
    "data. This mathematical function that encapsulates this error is known\n",

    "Various approaches to supervised learning use different prediction\n",

    "For example, *deep learning* makes use of *neural networks* to form the\n",

    "function that allows the algorithm designer to introduce invariances\n",
    "into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in a\n",
    "machine learning model. For example, in an image, a car is still a car\n",
    "regardless of whether it’s in the upper left or lower right corner of\n",
