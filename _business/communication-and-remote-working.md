\subsection{Conclusions}

* Both Local and Remote Environments are Important
* Regular Social Alignment is Missing
  * Trust is easily lost and difficult to regain.
* More Structured Meetings might be Necessary
* Mechanisms to Hear Everyone
* There *will* be background processes for remote people.
  * Is this healthy or us and them?
  
\subsection{Next Steps}

* Agree challenges and meeting tenets across both sites.
* Ensure local teams buy in. 
* Rigorously apply those tenets.
* Rigorously review those tenets.
