:title: The Data Farm
:abstract: 'Like Hansel and Gretelâ€™s breadcrumbs into the forest we leave a data trail
  of data-crumbs wherever we go: social networks, mobile phones, hospital visits,
  credit cards and loyalty cards. Our every move is being watched! The data-crumbs
  are seeds of information but what results from them... is it a jungle with dangers
  lurking or a productive farmyard? And if our data is being farmed, where does all
  the produce go?\\\\This edition of the talk was given to an age group between 8
  and 10.'
