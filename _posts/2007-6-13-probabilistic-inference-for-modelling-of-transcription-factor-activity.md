:abstract: 'Accurate modelling of transcriptional processes in the cell requires the
  knowledge of a number of key biological quantities. In practice many of them are
  difficult to measure in vivo. For example, it is very hard to measure the active
  concentration levels of the transcription factor proteins that drive the process.\\\\
  In this talk we will show how, by making use of structural information about the
  interaction network (e.g. arising form ChIP-chip data), transcription factor activities
  can estimated using probabilistic inference. We propose two different probabilistic
  models: a simple linear model with Kalman filter based dynamics for genome/transcriptome
  wide studies and a differential equation based Gaussian process model with a more
  physically realistic parameterisation for smaller interaction networks.'
