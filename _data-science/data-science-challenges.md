title: Challenges in Data Science
layout: slides

abstract: >
  Data science presents new opportunities but also new challenges. In
  this talk we will focus on three separate challenges for data
  science: 1. Paradoxes of the Data Society, 2. Quantifying the Value
  of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization. Each of these
  challenges has particular implications for data science.  The
  paradoxes relate to our evolving relationship with data and our
  changing expectations.  Quantifying value is vital for accounting
  for the influence of data in our new digital economies and issues of
  privacy and loss of control are fundamental to how our pre-existing
  rights evolve as the digital world encroaches more closely on the
  physical. One of the goals of open data science should be to address
  these challenges to ensure that we can avoid the pitfalls of the
  data driven society, allowing us to reap the benefits of data
  science in applications from personalized health to the developing
  world.
