  Spectral approaches to dimensionality reduction typically reduce the
  dimensionality of a data set through taking the eigenvectors of a
  Laplacian or a similarity matrix. Classical multidimensional scaling
  also makes use of the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix. In this talk
  we introduce a maximum entropy approach to designing this similarity
  matrix. The approach is closely related to maximum variance unfolding
  and other spectral approaches such as locally linear embeddings and
  Laplacian eigenmaps also turn out to be closely related. Each method can
  be seen as a sparse Gaussian graphical model where correlations between
  data points (rather than across data features) are specified in the
  graph. This also suggests optimization via sparse inverse covariance
  techniques such as the graphical LASSO. The hope is that this unifying
  perspective will allow the relationships between these methods to be
  better understood and will also provide the groundwork for further
  research.
