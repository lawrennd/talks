author: Lawrence, Neil D.
title: The Data Farm
abstract: 'Like Hansel and Gretelâ€™s breadcrumbs into the forest we leave a data trail
  of data-crumbs wherever we go: social networks, mobile phones, hospital visits,
  credit cards and loyalty cards. Our every move is being watched! The data-crumbs
  are seeds of information but what results from them... is it a jungle with dangers
  lurking or a productive farmyard? And if our data is being farmed, where does all
  the produce go?'
venue: Sheffield Festival of Engineering and Science, Jessop West Exhibition Space,
  Jessop West, University of Sheffield, 1 Upper Hanover Street, Sheffield S3 7RA
