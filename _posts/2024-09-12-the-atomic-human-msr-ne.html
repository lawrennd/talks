title: "The Atomic Human"
venue: "MSR New England, Cambridge MA"
abstract: "<p>By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied)
intelligence with the capabilities of machine intelligence through
history, The Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities
and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or we
become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose the
future we want.</p>
<p>Neilâ€™s book reveals the technical origins, capabilities and
limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded; not just by
the experts, but also ordinary people. In this conversation Neil will
discuss with Mary Gray the origins of these ideas and how we can better
shape the conversation around AI.</p>"
