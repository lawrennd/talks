title: "Post-Digital Transformation: Intellectual Debt"
abstract: "Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving from a manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers, logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges may start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the notion of 'post digital transformation': the challenges of doing business in a digital world."

\notes{Any policy question can be framed in a number of different
ways - what are the health outcomes; what is the impact on NHS
capacity; how are different groups affected; what is the economic
impact – and each has different types of evidence associated with
it. Complex and uncertain challenges require efforts to draw insights
together from across disciplines.}
