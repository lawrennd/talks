title: What kind of AI have we created?
abstract: The media is full of concerns about our data and how algorithms are affecting
  us. We worry about personal information becoming public, we worry about what intelligent
  machines have in store for us. This talk will be about the state of the art in terms
  of Artificial Intelligence. It will consider what it can do and what it can’t do.
  We are a long way away from implementing a ’sentient intelligence’, but what do
  we have in its place? This talk will explore current technology and speculate on
  what futures it may lead to.
