abstract: A simple approach to target identification through gene expression studies
  has been to cluster the expression profiles and look for coregulated genes within
  clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models of gene expression are typically
  constructed through differential equations. mRNAâ€™s production is taken to be proportional
  to transcription factor activity (with the proportionality given by the sensitivity)
  and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular rate. The assumption that coregulated
  genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the decay and the sensitivity
  are high. In this talk we advocate model based target identification. We develop
  a simple probabilistic models of transcription (and translation) which encode mRNA
  (or Transcription Factor) production and decay. Our models are simple enough to
  allow genome wide target identification, but rich enough to encode dynamical behavior
  that, allowing us to identify putative targets even when decay rates are low.
