title: "Machine Learning and the Physical World"
abstract: |
  You can’t have trust without understanding. We must view the systems we build as our tools, because if we can’t manipulate these systems, then we are at risk of being manipulated by these systems. Inspired by the centrifugal governor, this talk describes how statistical emulation provides a possible root for giving understanding to complex AI systems at a level of abstraction that allows humans to view the system as a tool, rather than being a tool of the system.

\newslide{The Gap}

* There is a gap between the world of data science and AI.
* The mapping of the virtual onto the physical world.
* E.g. Causal understanding.
