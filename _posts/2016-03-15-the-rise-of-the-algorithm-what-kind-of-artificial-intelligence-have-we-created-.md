title: 'The Rise of the Algorithm: What Kind of Artificial Intelligence have we Created?'
abstract: |
  The media is full of concerns about our data and how algorithms are
  affecting us. We worry about personal information becoming public, we
  worry about what intelligent machines have in store for us. This talk
  will be about the state of the art in terms of Artificial Intelligence.
  It will consider what it can do and what it can’t do. We are a long way
  away from implementing a ’sentient intelligence’, but what do we have in
  its place? This talk will explore current technology and speculate on
  what futures it may lead to.
