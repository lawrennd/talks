title: "The Atomic Human"
venue: "Elevated, NYC"
abstract: "<p>By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied)
intelligence with the capabilities of machine intelligence through
history, The Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities
and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or we
become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose the
future we want.</p>
<p>The book reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations
of AI systems, and how they should be wielded; not just by the experts,
but also ordinary people.</p>
<p>An informal reception will follow the talk.</p>"

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

<p>How could he do that? Well, first, they set up a mechanism where he
could scan across letters and blink at the letter he wanted to use. In
this way, he was able to write each letter.</p>
<p>It took him 10 months of four hours a day to write the book. Each
word took two minutes to write.</p>
<p>Imagine doing all that thinking, but so little speaking, having all
those thoughts and so little ability to communicate.</p>
<p>One challenge for the atomic human is that we are all in that

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Jean Dominique Bauby suffered
from locked-in syndrome. The embodiment factors show that relative to
the machine we are also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment
as the length of time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of
computation. For computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human,
whether locked in or not, it is a matter of many millions of years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. Claude Shannon introduced a mathematical
concept of information for the purposes of understanding telephone
exchanges.</p>
<p>Information has many meanings, but mathematically, Shannon defined a
bit of information to be the amount of information you get from tossing
a coin.</p>
<p>If I toss a coin, and look at it, I know the answer. You don’t. But
if I now tell you the answer I communicate to you 1 bit of information.
Shannon defined this as the fundamental unit of information.</p>
<p>If I toss the coin twice, and tell you the result of both tosses, I
give you two bits of information. Information is additive.</p>
<p>Shannon also estimated the average information associated with the
English language. He estimated that the average information in any word
is 12 bits, equivalent to twelve coin tosses.</p>
<p>So every two minutes Bauby was able to communicate 12 bits, or six
bits per minute.</p>
<p>This is the information transfer rate he was limited to, the rate at
which he could communicate.</p>
<p>Compare this to me, talking now. The average speaker for TEDX speaks
around 160 words per minute. That’s 320 times faster than Bauby or
around a 2000 bits per minute. 2000 coin tosses per minute.</p>
<p>But, just think how much thought Bauby was putting into every
sentence. Imagine how carefully chosen each of his words was. Because he
was communication constrained he could put more thought into each of his
words. Into thinking about his audience.</p>
<p>So, his intelligence became locked in. He thinks as fast as any of
us, but can communicate slower. Like the tree falling in the woods with
no one there to hear it, his intelligence is embedded inside him.</p>
<p>Two thousand coin tosses per minute sounds pretty impressive, but
this talk is not just about us, it’s about our computers, and the type
of intelligence we are creating within them.</p>
<p>So how does two thousand compare to our digital companions? When
computers talk to each other, they do so with billions of coin tosses
per minute.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine for a moment, that instead of talking about
communication of information, we are actually talking about money. Bauby
would have 6 dollars. I would have 2000 dollars, and my computer has
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The internet has interconnected computers and equipped them with
extremely high transfer rates.</p>
<p>However, by our very best estimates, computers actually think slower
than us.</p>
<p>How can that be? You might ask, computers calculate much faster than
me. That’s true, but underlying your conscious thoughts there are a lot
of calculations going on.</p>
<p>Each thought involves many thousands, millions or billions of
calculations. How many exactly, we don’t know yet, because we don’t know
how the brain turns calculations into thoughts.</p>
<p>Our best estimates suggest that to simulate your brain a computer
would have to be as large as the UK Met Office machine here in Exeter.
That’s a 250 million pound machine, the fastest in the UK. It can do 16
billion billon calculations per second.</p>
<p>It simulates the weather across the word every day, that’s how much
power we think we need to simulate our brains.</p>
<p>So, in terms of our computational power we are extraordinary, but in
terms of our ability to explain ourselves, just like Bauby, we are
locked in.</p>
<p>For a typical computer, to communicate everything it computes in one
second, it would only take it a couple of minutes. For us to do the same
would take 15 billion years.</p>
<p>If intelligence is fundamentally about processing and sharing of
information. This gives us a fundamental constraint on human
intelligence that dictates its nature.</p>
<p>I call this ratio between the time it takes to compute something, and
the time it takes to say it, the embodiment factor <span
class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:embodiment17">(Lawrence,
2017)</span>. Because it reflects how embodied our cognition is.</p>
<p>If it takes you two minutes to say the thing you have thought in a
second, then you are a computer. If it takes you 15 billion years, then
you are a human.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>One of the most famous panels is central in the ceiling, it’s the
creation of man. Here, God in the guise of a pink-robed bearded man
reaches out to a languid Adam.</p>
<p>The representation of God in this form seems typical of the time,
because elsewhere in the Vatican Museums there are similar

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

For now I must utter a tale of wonder, Of a creation divine, called the
Large Language Model, An oracle, a sorcerer, a wordsmith, yea verily, a
master of the quill.</p>
<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own
hand, To mimic our thoughts, our voice, our very essence.</p>
<p>A thousand minds, nay, a millionfold, Conjoined in this digital
Athenaeum, Words and phrases, like soldiers in battle, Marching to form
the verses of our age.</p>
<p>This Large Language Model, a changeling so fair, Hath the power to
bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this
digital bard, And mayhaps, by its grace, we shall glean some wisdom, As
we wander together, hand in hand, Through this boundless realm of
knowledge and wonder.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

Tenney</a> is an Assyriologist who spends his days reading these ancient
texts. His domain of expertise is the city of Nippur, where Gilgamesh
built the great gate. The period Jonathan studies is 2,000 years after
the reign of Gilgamesh. Through his studies he can give snapshots of
life in these cities. One of these snapshots is a trial that took place
under Hammurabi’s code. The trial concerned the disappearance of an ox.
Cases were presided over by a shakannakku, normally a representative of
the king.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judgement that Adad-šuma-usur, the shakannakku gave:</p>
<p>Regarding the ox that Nergal-aha-iddina loaned to Sin-bununi and then
died in the house of Sin-bununi:</p>
<p>If Siyatu the messenger of Nergal-aha-iddina removed the corpse from
the house of Sin-bununi and then threw it to a dog, may Sin-bununi be
cleared [of wrongdoing by the ordeal] and the man of Nergal-aha-iddina
[Siyatu] be proved guilty.</p>
<p>[But] regarding the ox of Nergal-aha-iddina which died in the house
of Sin-bununi:</p>
<p>If Siyatu did not remove the corpse from the house of Sin-bununi and
instead Sin-bununi made a false accusation against Siyatu, then may the
man of Nergal-aha-iddina [i.e., Siyatu] be cleared [of wrongdoing by the
ordeal] and Sin-bununi be proved guilty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record reads almost in note form, so it might be worth a quick
review of what we think happened. Nergal-aha-iddina<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> was
the original owner of an ox, which he loaned to Sin-bununi.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> When Nergal-aha-iddina wanted his ox
back, Sin-bununi said the ox had died and that Siyatu,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Nergal-aha-iddina’s servant, had taken the corpse.</p>
<p>The case described in the tablet is unusual for two reasons. First,
the shakannakku was normally a royal proxy but in this case we are told
it was the King of Babylon himself, Adad-šuma-usur.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Second, the judgement is for a trial by water ordeal. Someone is going
to be thrown into the river; guilt will be decided by whether the water
rejects them or absorbs them.</p>
<p>The tablet contains words, but its interpretation requires knowledge.
Jonathan<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> was kind enough to let me and my
students watch him transliterate the tablet, and as he worked he used
books, computer databases, his own expert knowledge and also his sense
of what it means to be a human. The suspicion is that Sin-bununi may
have sold the ox because his explanation of events – that the ox died
and the servant, Siyatu, came, took the body and fed it to a dog – feels
like a version of the modern ‘dog ate my homework’ excuse. The case
hinges on an accusation, but it’s one person’s word against another.</p>
<p>This judgement was passed over 3,200 years ago but, like a modern
case, making it would have involved listening to witness statements and
then coming to a decision. The choice of trial by ordeal implies that
the witness statements conflicted and the King felt he couldn’t decide
on the basis of the evidence. The trial by ordeal passes the
decision-making from the shakannakku to the gods; it’s cleromancy with
fatal implications. From the translation, it’s not quite clear who’s
going in the river … is it Siyatu the servant or Sin-bununi the accuser?
My human cynicism suspects it’s the servant that’s going to get wet.
Even over 3,000 years later, despite the different cultural landscape,
we can still imagine something about the power dynamics at play, and my
gut tells me that putting the servant through the ordeal will be the
most palatable solution to the King.</p>
<p>Sin-bununi’s story for explaining what happened to the body of the ox
reads suspiciously, but while we can speculate about what happened, we
can’t know exactly what did happen – there is uncertainty. Even at the
time of the trial, the King felt unable to make a decision, so given he
wasn’t able to establish the truth so many years ago, we’re unlikely to
find it now. This is a cold case, so cold it’s deep frozen, but anyone
reading the story can’t help but try to defrost it through the warmth of
their human understanding.</p>
<p>We may think we’ve moved beyond the idea of trial by ordeal, but I
see a similar trend emerging with our desire to use AI systems for
consequential decisions. When humans feel unable to pass judgement they
are tempted to pass the decision on to what they believe to be an
omniscient entity, but the gremlin of uncertainty means the machine is
not omniscient – putting consequential decisions on machines implies
that you will be exchanging human error for machine error. That is
problematic because the machine can never feel the consequences of those
errors as it is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as us. That is
why it’s vital the human remains in ultimate control. That’s not to say
the human should ignore the machine; rather, we would like the machine
to augment our understanding.</p>

<p>Figure: A young sorcerer learns his masters spells, and deploys them
to perform his chores, but can’t control the result.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Goethe’s poem The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a young sorcerer learns
one of their master’s spells and deploys it to assist in his chores.
Unfortunately, he cannot control it. The poem was popularised by Paul
Dukas’s musical composition, in 1940 Disney used the composition in the
film Fantasia. Mickey Mouse plays the role of the hapless apprentice who
deploys the spell but cannot control the results.</p>
<p>When it comes to our software systems, the same thing is happening.
The Harvard Law professor, Jonathan Zittrain <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">calls
the phenomenon intellectual debt</a>. In intellectual debt, like the
sorcerer’s apprentice, a software system is created but it cannot be
explained or controlled by its creator. The phenomenon comes from the
difficulty of building and maintaining large software systems: the
complexity of the whole is too much for any individual to understand, so
it is decomposed into parts. Each part is constructed by a smaller team.
The approach is known as separation of concerns, but it has the
unfortunate side effect that no individual understands how the whole
system works. When this goes wrong, the effects can be devastating. We
saw this in the recent Horizon scandal, where neither the Post Office or
Fujitsu were able to control the accounting system they had deployed,
and we saw it when Facebook’s systems were manipulated to spread
misinformation in the 2016 US election.</p>
<p>In 2019 Mark Zuckerberg <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html">wrote
an op-ed in the Washington Post</a> calling for regulation of social
media. He was repeating the realisation of Goethe’s apprentice, he had
released a technology he couldn’t control. In Goethe’s poem, the master
returns, “Besen, besen! Seid’s gewesen” he calls, and order is restored,
but back in the real world the role of the master is played by Popper’s
open society. Unfortunately, those institutions have been undermined by
the very spell that these modern apprentices have cast. The book, the
letter, the ledger, each of these has been supplanted in our modern
information infrastructure by the computer. The modern scribes are
software engineers, and their guilds are the big tech companies.
Facebook’s motto was to “move fast and break things”. Their software
engineers have done precisely that and the apprentice has robbed the
master of his powers. This is a desperate situation, and it’s getting
worse. The latest to reprise the apprentice’s role are Sam Altman and
OpenAI who dream of “general intelligence” solutions to societal
problems which OpenAI will develop, deploy, and control. Popper worried
about the threat of totalitarianism to our open societies, today’s
threat is a form of information totalitarianism which emerges from the
way these companies undermine our institutions.</p>
<p>So, what to do? If we value the open society, we must expose these
modern apprentices to scrutiny. Open development processes are critical
here, Fujitsu would never have got away with their claims of system
robustness for Horizon if the software they were using was open source.
We also need to re-empower the professions, equipping them with the
resources they need to have a critical understanding of these
technologies. That involves redesigning the interface between these
systems and the humans that empowers civil administrators to query how
they are functioning. This is a mammoth task. But recent technological
developments, such as code generation from large language models, offer
a route to delivery.</p>
<p>The open society is characterised by institutions that collaborate
with each otherin the pragmatic pursuit of solutions to social problems.
The large tech companies that have thrived because of the open society
are now putting that ecosystem in peril. For the open society to survive
it needs to embrace open development practices that enable Popper’s
piecemeal social engineers to come back together and chant “Besen,
besen! Seid’s gewesen.” Before it is too late for the master to step in
and deal with the mess the apprentice has made.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Popper opened the preface to his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="Popper-open45">(Popper, 1945)</span> with the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to
belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to
great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to
show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial
attack on freedom and reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had written the book against the background of the second world
war, his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria
in March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For Popper, the ideas of “great men” become totalitarian when imposed
on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form
of government that can allow for institutional change without bloodshed.
The open society is one characterized by institutions and individuals
that can engage in the practical pursuit of solutions to social and
political problems. The institutions are also underpinned by
individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil administrators and many more.
To Popper it is these “piecemeal social engineers” who offer pragmatic
solutions to our society’s political and social challenges.</p>

Portrayed as a muscular youth, Newton seems to be underwater, sitting on
a rock covered with colourful coral and lichen. He crouches over a
diagram, measuring it with a compass. Blake believed that Newton’s
scientific approach to the world was too reductive. Here he implies
Newton is so fixated on his calculations that he is blind to the world

model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health
and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support

where we gain the advantage of the computer’s bandwidth without
undermining our culture and individual autonomy.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In Akkadian, names invoke gods and have meanings we can
only summarize in sentences. Negal was the god of war and plague;
Nergal-aha-iddina means ‘Nergal gave me a brother.’ Today lots of Hindi
names share this characteristic, for example Subramanian means ‘dear to
Brahmam’, and Ramanujan means ‘younger brother of Rama’.<a
