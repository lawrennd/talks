title: 'The Rise of the Algorithm: What is the AI that we have created?'
abstract: There have been fears voiced by Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking about the
  direction of artificial intelligent research. They worry about the creation of a
  sentient AI, one that might outwit us. However, the nature of the AI we have actually
  created is a long way distant from this. In this talk we will try and relate our
  models of artificial intelligence to models that have been proposed for the way
  humans think. The AI that Hawking and Musk fear is not yet here, but is the AI we
  have actually developed more or less disturbing than the vision they project?
