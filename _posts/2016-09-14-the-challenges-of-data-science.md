title: The Challenges of Data Science
abstract: 'Data science presents new opportunities but also new challenges. In this
  talk we will focus on three separate challenges for data science: 1. Paradoxes of
  the Data Society, 2. Quantifying the Value of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of control,
  marginalization. Each of these challenges has particular implications for data science.
  The paradoxes relate to our evolving relationship with data and our changing expectations.
  Quantifying value is vital for accounting for the influence of data in our new digital
  economies and issues of privacy and loss of control are fundamental to how our pre-existing
  rights evolve as the digital world encroaches more closely on the physical. By addressing
  these challenges now we can ensure that the pitfalls of the data driven society
  are overcome allowing us to reap the benefits of data science in applications from
  personalized health to the developing world.'
