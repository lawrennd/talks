title: "The Atomic Human: In Conversation with Sylvie Delacroix"
abstract: >
  The Centre for data Futures celebrates the publication of ‘The Atomic Human’ by Professor Neil Lawrence with a cross-disciplinary conversation.

  Professor Sylvie Delacroix, Director of the Centre for Data Futures, will host a conversation with Neil about The Atomic Human, whose publication comes at a pivotal point in the so-called ‘AI revolution’. What does it take for us to not only choose but carve out a future where ‘AI is a tool for us’? Who does the ‘us’ stand for? Does the fact that this revolution is powered by a resource -data- that largely comes from us change anything?
