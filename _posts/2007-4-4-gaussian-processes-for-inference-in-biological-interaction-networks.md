:title: Gaussian Processes for Inference in Biological Interaction Networks
:abstract: In many biological applications key functions of interest, such as chemical
  species concentrations, are unobserved.  In this talk we will briefly introduce
  Gaussian processes, which are probabilistic models of functions. We will show how
  they can be used, in combination with a simple differential equation model, to estimate
  the concentration of a transcription factor in a simple single input module network
  motif.
