title: 'The Digital Oligarchy: Information, Knowledge and the Internet Era'
venue: Right First Time, ControlPoint Event
abstract: The data revolution is among us and the technical press is filled with stories
  of big data and artificial intelligence. What is driving this progress? In this
  talk we will argue that collection of data on its own is of little utility, it is
  interconnection of data that allows information to become knowledge. Businesses
  need to place data at the core of what they do to benefit from these techniques.
  The talk will be grounded in academic ideas of what information, knowledge and data
  are. But these concepts have practical utility that can influence decision making
  on where data sits within an organisation.
