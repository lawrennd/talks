title: Variational Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  In this talk we will review the variational approximation to Gaussian
  processes which enables Bayesian learning of latent variables. We will
  focus in particular on a new explanation of the variational approach
  that also leads to stochastic variational inference for GPs.
