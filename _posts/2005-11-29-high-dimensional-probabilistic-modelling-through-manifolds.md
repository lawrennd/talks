:title: High Dimensional Probabilistic Modelling through Manifolds
:abstract: Density modelling in high dimensions is a very difficult problem. Traditional
  approaches, such as mixtures of Gaussians, typically fail to capture the structure
  of data sets in high dimensional spaces. In this talk we will argue that for many
  data sets of interest, the data can be represented as a lower dimensional manifold
  immersed in the higher dimensional space. We will then present the Gaussian Process
  Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM), a non-linear probabilistic variant of principal
  component analysis (PCA) which implicitly assumes that the data lies on a lower
  dimensional space. We will demonstrate the application of the model to a range of
  data sets, but with a particular focus on human motion data. We will show some preliminary
  work on facial animation and make use of a skeletal motion capture data set to illustrate
  differences between our model and traditional manifold techniques.
