title: Flexible Parametric Representations of Non Parametric Models
abstract: |
  In the age of large streaming data it seems appropriate to revisit the
  foundations of what we think of as data modelling. In this talk I’ll
  argue that traditional statistical approaches based on parametric models
  and i.i.d. assumptions are inappropriate for the type of large scale
  machine learning we need to do in the age of massive streaming data
  sets. I’ll be arguing for flexible non-parametric models as the answer.
  This presents a particular challenge, non parametric models require data
  storage of the entire data set, which presents problems for massive,
  streaming data. I’ll argue that recently proposed variational
  approximations allow us to retain the advantages of both non-parametric
  and parametric models within a consistent framework that performs an
  optimal compression of our data from an information gain perspective.
