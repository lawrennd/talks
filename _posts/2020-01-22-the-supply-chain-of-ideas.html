<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Jeff owns a large shop. He doesn’t know what the future looks like, but what he does know is that his customers won’t want to pay more than they pay today. They won’t want to wait longer for orders. And they won’t want a reduced selection in his store.</p>
<p>Jeff worries about the future a lot, and so he’s always making sure that his cusotmers pay less, don’t have to wait and have the best selection available.</p>
<p>I like the simplicity of Jeff’s perspective. Predicting what will happen in the future is difficult, but predicting what won’t happen is sometimes easier. Jeff’s real point is that for his shop, he wants all his staff to be focussing on all of these things all the time.</p>
<p>The way Jeff does this is that he focusses on his supply chain. He realises that always having the right things in stock brings customers back. So he’s prepared to make a loss on some products to maintain customer loyalty. Jeff’s main business is deliveries, and his biggest sales occur in the Christmas period. Jeff’s supply chain is designed to deliver Christmas. He is Father Christmas, Papa Noel, Santa Claus, Christkind, Bom Velhinho and the Befana rolled into one. His entire supply chain is designed to deliver on the gift giving at this time of year.</p>

</div>
<p>To deliver all these presents, just like Santa, Jeff has a fleet of flying machines. Some of these flying machines are designed to go across continents. And some of these flying machines are designed to go across towns. They don’t drop presents down your chimney, but they come close.</p>

<p>Jeff has another big worry. He thinks his store is the most innovative, but he’s always horizon scanning. Jeff grew his store by exploiting the latest technology, being agile in his thinking and always staying one step ahead of his rivals. He asks all his staff to always be looking out for ways they can improve, to see what the new innovations are, to think about how the store can use them.</p>
<p>Jeff knows that one day a young rival will come along with a new way of delivering products, of delivering gifts, and that young rival will put him out of business. Although he’s never said it, I think that deep down, Jeff actually likes this idea, he thinks that’s the way it should be. But still, he wants to delay the day that this happens to his store as long as possible.</p>
<p>Jeff sees this challenge as the innovator’s dilemma. The idea that one day his staff will become complacent, they’ll stop looking at ways to improve. I’ve not talked to Jeff much about innovation, but I do know he thinks that an idea can never be disruptive unless its deployed to the customer.</p>

<p>Figure: The innovator’s dilemma explains the challenge of being the encumbent business with refined processes, but not being agile enough to respond when new technology arrives. This is what keeps the little Jeff in my head awake at night.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I used to work for Jeff, and one of the things I noticed about working for Jeff is he puts a lot of effort in trying to get you to understand how he thinks. He doesn’t want to tell you what to do, he doesn’t have the time. His company is too big. He wants you to know how he thinks about stuff. He wants to put a little Jeff inside your head. So when you’re making a decision about something, you don’t have to ask the real Jeff, you just ask the little Jeff inside your head. When I was working for Jeff, I was responsible for innovation. Jeff got interested in a set of techniques I’m an expert in and he wanted me to look at how they might help his store. I did work on that, but I’m not going to tell you too much about that today. But before I left I got to thinking about how innovation works, and how it might work better for Jeff’s store.</p>
<p>I never got a chance to talk to Jeff in person about this, but I did spend a lot of time with the Jeff inside my head. And here’s what he said to me.</p>
<p>He said: Neil, I don’t know what the future’s going to look like in terms of innovation. But I do know that my store is never going to want to pay more for ideas, it’s never going to want to have to wait longer for those ideas to be deployed for our customers and it’s never going to want to have fewer ideas available.</p>
<p>Now, apart maybe I’m not a very imaginative person, or maybe I was putting too little effort into imagining Jeff, or maybe I was spending too much time working on supply chain, but I started thinking. Huh, that sounds an awful lot like what Jeff says about delivering parcels. And that’s how the idea for the “Supply Chain of Ideas” came about.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine who still works for Jeff is called Narayan. He liked to tell me about a man by a river in Kerala, South India who sold coconuts. The man sat beside a river and sold coconuts to people on boats. The man would sit under a coconut tree. When someone stopped to buy a coconut the man would climb the tree and cut down a coconut and sell it to the customer. When that tree ran out of coconuts the man would move to another tree. Narayan used to say that this man had the shortest supply chain in the world. Then Narayan would laugh his booming laugh.</p>
<p>When he’d stopped laughing, Narayan would tell me that the magic of supply chain is it takes the waiting away. It makes all the customers feel that everything grows on trees, and its all sitting there ripe and ready to pluck. And all that’s happening is that the store-owner is popping up the tree and bringing us a fresh one down.</p>

<p>Narayan once visited me in Cambridge. He wanted to go out to eat so he got a restaurant recommendation. Narayan lives in California but he’s originally from Mumbai. I suppose whoever he asked was very proud of the Indian food in Cambridge because they told him to go to the best Indian Restaurant in Cambridge. That restaurant is called the Tiffin Truck.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The next day I saw Narayan and when I asked him about his dinner he scowled a bit. He asked if I knew what a Tiffin Box was. I didn’t. Then Narayan told me about the dabbawalas.</p>
<p>The dabbawalas work mainly in Mumbai. Every day they deliver lunches to people’s offices. But they are not like Just Eat, or Deliveroo, or any of the new gig economy services. They deliver each lunch freshly made from people’s <em>homes</em>. They are a distribution system that takes a freshly made lunch from your house to your desk. The lunches are stored in Tiffin Boxes. The Tiffin Boxes are passed form one dabbawala to another. Some are on trains and some are on bicycles. Eventually a fresh lunch from your home arrives at your desk. After you are finished, the dabbawalas take your Tiffin Box back home for you. The magic of supply chain is in the links that makes this happen.</p>
<p>Because Narayan worked in California and I worked in Cambridge. We would always be in meetings on video screens. Because I was new in the team, and he was an expert in supply chain, after each meeting Narayan would spend some time explaining to me what was going on. I think this is how I ended up with a little Narayan in my head to keep the little Jeff company.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/11/mumbais-models-of-service-excellence">There are around 5000 dabbawalas in Mumbai</a>, and each day they deliver around 130,000 lunch boxes. The service is over 120 years old. It continues to deliver during monsoons, riots, famines and terrorist attacks. Can you imagine how important it is for the system that everyday they turn up and do their job? If anything goes wrong, they have to quickly adapt and plug the gap.</p>
<p>There is a parallel between the dabbawalas and the supply chain in Jeff’s store. There is constant troubleshooting and a daily pressure to deliver, to keep the system moving. And this is where the innovator’s dilemma comes back in. If you’re so busy efficiently delivering parcels on a daily basis, you can’t stop and think about how you might want to deliver parcels in the future. You don’t have time to think and reflect.</p>
<p>So maybe when Jeff says he needs the team to deliver faster, not everyone’s always had the time to reflect on how we might be doing that. The teams focussed on delivering, not innovating.</p>
<p>This is where the supply chain of ideas comes in. As a scientist in the team, I was a bit like the guy sitting beside the river under a coconut palm. My tree contained a team that could design machine learning solutions. You could have idea you liked, as long as it was a coconut.</p>
<p>Other companies like to do it differently, they like to put their scientists together in one big research center. They like them to be dreaming up any kind of new idea.</p>
<p>The research center is like having a warehouse of ideas. It contains coconuts, and pappaya and mango and any type of fruit you can think of. The problem is, it’s nowhere near the river. And the people The problem is that its the people on the river that need the coconuts. And the river’s a long way from the research center.</p>
<p>Now before he met little Narayan, he really liked the coconut model. He knew that we also need mango-ideas and pappaya-ideas, but he also knows that there’s no point in having a warehouse far away from the river. Those mangos and pappayas will just rot on the shelf of academic publication.</p>
<p>So the right thing to do is build a ‘general store’ near the river. This general store will hold on to ideas that are thought to be needed, and a supply chain of ideas will feed the general store.</p>
<p>But as Jeff’s store gets bigger and more innovation is required, an entire network of innovation is needed. The range of ideas is so wide and the demand for ideas so unpredictable that it becomes like the dabbawala.</p>
<p>And Jeff’s store already does this. His store is actually a collection of many stores, if you want to sell something you can do it by renting space in Jeff’s store. He will bring the customers in, you just need to rent the space and deliver your sales.</p>
<p>So the little Jeff and the little Narayan inside my head have realised that the solution to the innovators dilemma is the supply chain of ideas. To have great communications, like the dabbawalas between the origin of the ideas and the destination of the ideas.</p>
<p>This means they need to understand what the ideas are and where they should be deployed.</p>
<p>The first step is forming an inventory of existing ideas, and where they are being deployed. The next step is assessing the future demand for ideas, and the final step is matching that demand to the suppliers of those ideas. This requires the intellectual transport network. Little Jeff knows that it will be impossible for his store to have all the ideas from his own employees that he needs to keep on innovating. He can make a research center, an idea factory, and that will help. But the reality of the supply chain of ideas is about the discoverability of the ideas and the assessment of demand for the ideas.</p>
