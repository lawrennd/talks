### Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* What does it mean for IoT

### Internet of People

* Fog computing: barrier between cloud and device blurring.

* Stuxnet: Adversarial and Security implications for intelligent systems.

* Complex feedback between algorithm and implementation
  

### Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization
