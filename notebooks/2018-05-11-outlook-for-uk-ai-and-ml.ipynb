    "$$ \\text{data} + \\text{model} \\xrightarrow{\\text{compute}} \\text{prediction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively\n",
    "acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on\n",
    "previous experience. THat experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To\n",
    "combine data with a model we typically make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a prediction function** a function which is used to make the\n",
    "predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the\n",
    "universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness,\n",
    "spatial similarities, temporal similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**an objective function** a function which defines the cost of\n",
    "misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world's\n",
    "generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for\n",
    "mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of data and model through the prediction function and\n",
    "the objectie function leads to a *learning algorithm*. The class of\n",
    "prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is\n",
    "restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or\n",

    "Machine learning technologies have been the driver of two related, but\n",
    "distinct disciplines. The first is *data science*. Data science is an\n",
    "emerging field that arises from the fact that we now collect so much\n",
    "data by happenstance, rather than by *experimental design*. Classical\n",
    "statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data, and to do so\n",
    "statistical experiments are carefully designed. In the modern era we\n",
    "collect so much data that there's a desire to draw inferences directly\n",
    "from the data.\n",

    "As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from\n",
    "statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data),\n",
    "visualization and data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on\n",
    "emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image,\n",
    "or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent\n",
    "advances in artifcial intelligence have come from machine learning\n",
    "providing the automation. But in contrast to data science, in artifcial\n",
    "intelligence the data is normally collected with the specific task in\n",

    "There are strong overlaps between the fields, the wide availability of\n",

    "systems. These relations are coming through wide availability of sensing\n",
    "technologies that are interconnected by celluar networks, WiFi and the\n",
