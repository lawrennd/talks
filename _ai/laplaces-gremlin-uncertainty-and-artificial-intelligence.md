title: "Laplace's Gremlin: Uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence"
abstract: >
  With breakthroughs in understanding images, translating language,
  transcribing speech artificial intelligence promises to
  revolutionise the technological landscape. Machine learning
  algorithms are able to convert unstructured data into actionable
  knowledge. With the increasing impact of these technologies,
  societyâ€™s interest is also growing.

  The word *intelligence* conjures notions of human-like
  capabilities. But are we really on the cusp of creating machines
  that match us? We associate intelligence with knowledge, but in this
  talk I will argue that the true marvel of our intelligence is the
  way it deals with ignorance.

  Despite the large strides forward we have made, I will argue that we
  have a long way to go to deliver on the promise of artificial
  intelligence. And it is a journey that our societies need to take
  together, not just as computer scientists, but together by
  rediscovering the interdisciplinary spirit that Celsius, Linnaeus
  and their contemporaries did so much to demonstrate.

As far as any sympathy with me, or with anyone else, I believe, he is an iceberg. His mind impresses one as a keen, cold, narrow logical machine, that cuts the universe into neat little packets, that measure, as it were, just three inches each way. His type of mathematical analysis he applies as a sort of Procrustean bed to the facts, and those that contain more than his system provides for, he lops short, and those that contain less, he draws out.

22nd sounds sensible.

I think bringing together the Accelerate, Turing and McGovern work could be interesting. Putting together under a theme â€¦ maybe that is supply chain of ideas. But need to relate that to passage of information and perhaps the role for ML in society??

How about I send out an invite for the afternoon of 22 January? (Give you a week or so of adjusting to term starting, but 3 weeks to make changes before the event?)
 
Also happy to kick around ideas before that, if useful. Feels like you could tie together intellectual debt and supply chain of ideas (what happens when you speed up the pace of coconut production?) and the characteristics you need for AI systems to work well with people.

Oooo! I was thinking about this the other day â€“ we could do a test run on this with the group. Sort of a dress rehearsal, if you want to try out different lines or ideas? But also a way of contributing to the process of introducing ML@CL and Accelerate to each other.

Hi Neil, 
 
We have a new initiative here at the university AI4Research where the focus is on developing AI/ML and in particular the use of AI/ML at a tool to develop other disciplines (medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.). Some background on the project is available here https://uu.se/en/research/ai4research/  and when I was asked to write about the ideas it resulted in this
https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/news/article/?id=14730&typ=artikel&lang=en
 
If you like these ideas and have a story that somehow aligns with this that would be great. However, I definitely do not want to force you into talking about this topic, I only mentioning it since you asked for some concrete ideas.
 
In any case, it is important that your talk is broadly accessible to a wide audience (Technology and Natural Science) at the same time as it remains scientific, which is of course the challenge with talks of this kind. 
 
Hope this can be of some help?
 
Best,
Thomas
