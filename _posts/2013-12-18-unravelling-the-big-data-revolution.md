:title: Unravelling the Big Data Revolution
:abstract: Modern data connectivity gives us massive uncurated data sets which present
  enormous challenges for modelling and inference. I'll review where I think this
  is taking mathematics and speculate on the methodological and social challenges
  that this revolution will entail with some final reflections on how it might effect
  the teaching curriculum.
