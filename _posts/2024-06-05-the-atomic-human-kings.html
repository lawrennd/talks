title: "The Atomic Human: In Conversation with Sylvie Delacroix"
venue: "Bush House"
abstract: "<p>The Centre for data Futures celebrates the publication of
‘The Atomic Human’ by Professor Neil Lawrence with a cross-disciplinary
conversation. Professor Sylvie Delacroix, Director of the Centre for
Data Futures, will host a conversation with Neil about The Atomic Human,
whose publication comes at a pivotal point in the so-called ‘AI
revolution’. What does it take for us to not only choose but carve out a
future where ‘AI is a tool for us’? Who does the ‘us’ stand for? Does
the fact that this revolution is powered by a resource -data- that
largely comes from us change anything?</p>"
