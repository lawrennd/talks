title: Kernels for Vector Valued Functions
abstract: |
  In this talk we review kernels for vector valued functions from the
  perspective of Gaussian processes. Deriving a multiple output Gaussian
  process from the perspective of a linear dynamical system (Kalman
  Filter) we introduce the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model and the
  Linear Model of Coregionalization. We discuss how they relate to
  multi-task learning with GPs and the Semi Parametric Latent Factor
  model. Finally, we will introduce convolutional process models from the
  perspective of the latent force model.
