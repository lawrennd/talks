title: The Power and Pitfalls of Machine Learning in the Design of New Molecules
abstract: |

  AI is currently revolutionising science. It is helping us to
  discover more promising candidates for therapeutic drugs; it is
  being used to generate more accurate weather forecasts; and it is at
  the forefront of efforts to tackle the biodiversity and climate
  crises. At this inaugural event, we explore the effects that AI is
  already having on science and those areas of science soon to be
  influenced.

  Professor Charlotte Deane MBE delivers our plenary talk, “The power
  and pitfalls of Machine Learning in the design of new molecules”.
  Professor Deane is Executive Chair of the Engineering and Physical
  Sciences Research Council, and Professor of Structural
  Bioinformatics in the Department of Statistics at the University of
  Oxford, where she leads the Oxford Protein Informatics Group.

  Following her talk, Professor Deane discusses "AI as the main driver for future science" in a panel session including:

  Professor Louise Slater is Professor of Hydroclimatology and
  Tutorial Fellow at Hertford College, University of Oxford. Louise
  leads the Hydro-Climate Extremes Research Group, which develops
  computational approaches to detect, attribute and predict how
  changes in climate and land cover may affect water-related extremes
  and society.

  Professor Neil Lawrence is the inaugural DeepMind Professor of
  Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge. He has been working
  on machine learning models for over 20 years and recently returned
  to academia after three years as Director of Machine Learning at
  Amazon. His main interest is the interaction of machine learning
  with the physical world.

  The panel is chaired by Professor Stephen Roberts, Professor of
  Machine Learning and Professorial Fellow at Somerville College,
  University of Oxford. Stephen is co-lead of Oxford’s Schmidt AI in
  Science Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme.
