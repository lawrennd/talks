title: The Mechanistic Fallacy and Modelling How We Think
abstract: |
  In this talk we will discuss how our current set of modelling
  solutions relates to dual process models from psychology. By
  analogising with layered models of networks we first address the
  danger of focussing purely on mechanism (or biological plausibility)
  when discussion modelling in the brain. We term this idea the
  mechanistic fallacy. In an attempt to operate at a higher level of
  abstraction, we then take a conceptual approach and attempt to map
  the broader domain of mechanistic and phenomological models to dual
  process ideas from psychology. it seems that System 1 is closer to
  phenomological and System 2 is closer to mechanistic ideas. We will
  draw connections to surrogate modelling (also known as emmulation)
  and speculate that one role of System 2 may be to provide additional
  simulation data for System 1.
