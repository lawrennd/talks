abstract:  >
  In this review and refresher notebook we remind ourselves about linear models and use the opportunity to provide some review of linear algebra. Most of the code you need is provided in the notebook, there are a few exercises to help develop your understanding.

\section{Introduction}

\notes{Welcome to the review and refresh practical. This work is for you to remind yourself about the ways of using the notebook. You will have a chance to ask us questions about the content on 9th of November. Within the material you will find exercises. If you are confident with probability you can likely ignore the reading and exercises which are listed from @Rogers:book11 and @Bishop:book06. There should be *no need* to purchase these books for this course. The suggestions of sections are there just as a reminder.}

\notes{We suggest you run these labs in *Google colab*, there's a link to doing that on the main lab page at the top. We also suggest that the first thing you do is click `View`->`Expand sections` to make all parts of the lab visibile.}

\notes{We suggest you complete at least Exercises 2-5.}

\subsection{Review}

* Last time: Looked at objective functions for movie recommendation.
* Minimized sum of squares objective by steepest descent and stochastic gradients.
* This time: explore least squares for regression.
