title: 'System Zero: What Kind of AI Have We Created?'
abstract: Machine learning technologies have evolved to the extent that they are now
  considered the principle underlying technology for our advances in artificial intelligence.
  Artificial intelligence is an emotive term, given the implications for replacing
  qualities that humans consider specific to ourselves. In this talk we’ll consider
  what kind of artificial intelligence we’ve created and what possible implications
  are for our society.
