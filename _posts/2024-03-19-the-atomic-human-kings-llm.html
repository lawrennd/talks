title: "Law and the Atomic Human"
venue: "King’s College London, LLM"
abstract: "<p>A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re
having about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our
identity?</p>
<p>Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI not
only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied
threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the
centre of the world.</p>
<p>Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components: eventually
we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek for uncuttable is
‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the facets of human
intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI uncovers what is left:
an indivisible core that is the essence of humanity.</p>
<p>I’ll contrast our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
with the capabilities of machine intelligence and speculate on what it
means for our futures.</p>
<p>This talk is based on Neil’s forthcoming book to be published with
Allen Lane in June 2024.</p>"

<p>Figure: The Atomic Eye, by slicing away aspects of the human that we

</div>
</div>
<p>The development of what some are calling <em>intelligence</em> in
machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for
our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from
Democritus’s atomism.</p>
<p>In the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">bce</span> the Greek
philosopher Democritus posed a similar question about our physical
universe. He imagined cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated
process: cutting a piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting
it again so that each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus
believed this process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with
an indivisible piece. The Greek word for indivisible is <em>atom</em>,
and so this theory was called <em>atomism</em>. This book considers this
question, but in a different domain, asking: As the machine slices away
portions of human capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity,
an indivisible piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does
the human disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.</p>

Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> is the autobiography of Jean Dominique
Bauby. Jean Dominique, the editor of French Elle magazine, suffered a
major stroke at the age of 43 in 1995. The stroke paralyzed him and
rendered him speechless. He was only able to blink his left eyelid, he
became a sufferer of locked in syndrome.</p>

<p>How could he do that? Well, first, they set up a mechanism where he
could scan across letters and blink at the letter he wanted to use. In
this way, he was able to write each letter.</p>
<p>It took him 10 months of four hours a day to write the book. Each
word took two minutes to write.</p>
<p>Imagine doing all that thinking, but so little speaking, having all
those thoughts and so little ability to communicate.</p>
<p>One challenge for the atomic human is that we are all in that

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lawrence:embodiment17">Lawrence (2017)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>

</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest

<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A

<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of

</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan
Zittrain has coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">“Intellectual
Debt”</a> to describe the challenge of understanding what you’ve
created. In <a
href="https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/data-oriented-architectures-for-ai-based-systems.html">the
ML@CL group we’ve been foucssing on developing the notion of a
<em>data-oriented architecture</em></a> to deal with intellectual debt
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cabrera-realworld23">(Cabrera et al.,
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability
of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine
learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and
transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if
we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe
this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining
regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”.
Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it
feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual,
because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation
task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting
individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can
linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual
tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore
fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>
<h2 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt</h2>
<p>In computer systems the concept of <em>technical debt</em> has been
surfaced by authors including <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sculley:debt15">Sculley et al. (2015)</span>. It is an
important concept, that I think is somewhat hidden from the academic
community, because it is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer
software system is deployed.</p>

<p>To construct such complex systems an approach known as “separation of
concerns” has been developed. The idea is that you architect your
system, which consists of a large-scale complex task, into a set of
simpler tasks. Each of these tasks is separately implemented. This is
known as the decomposition of the task.</p>
<p>This is where Jonathan Zittrain’s beautifully named term
“intellectual debt” rises to the fore. Separation of concerns enables
the construction of a complex system. But who is concerned with the
overall system?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical debt is the inability to <em>maintain</em> your complex
software system.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual debt is the inability to <em>explain</em> your
software system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is right there in our approach to software engineering.
“Separation of concerns” means no one is concerned about the overall
system itself.</p>

<p>Figure: the-sorcerers-apprentice</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Goethe’s poem The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a young sorcerer learns
one of their master’s spells and deploys it to assist in his chores.
Unfortunately, he cannot control it. The poem was popularised by Paul
Dukas’s musical composition, in 1940 Disney used the composition in the
film Fantasia. Mickey Mouse plays the role of the hapless apprentice who
deploys the spell but cannot control the results.</p>
<p>When it comes to our software systems, the same thing is happening.
The Harvard Law professor, Jonathan Zittrain <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">calls
the phenomenon intellectual debt</a>. In intellectual debt, like the
sorcerer’s apprentice, a software system is created but it cannot be
explained or controlled by its creator. The phenomenon comes from the
difficulty of building and maintaining large software systems: the
complexity of the whole is too much for any individual to understand, so
it is decomposed into parts. Each part is constructed by a smaller team.
The approach is known as separation of concerns, but it has the
unfortunate side effect that no individual understands how the whole
system works. When this goes wrong, the effects can be devastating. We
saw this in the recent Horizon scandal, where neither the Post Office or
Fujitsu were able to control the accounting system they had deployed,
and we saw it when Facebook’s systems were manipulated to spread
misinformation in the 2016 US election.</p>
<p>In 2019 Mark Zuckerberg <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html">wrote
an op-ed in the Washington Post</a> calling for regulation of social
media. He was repeating the realisation of Goethe’s apprentice, he had
released a technology he couldn’t control. In Goethe’s poem, the master
returns, “Besen, besen! Seid’s gewesen” he calls, and order is restored,
but back in the real world the role of the master is played by Popper’s
open society. Unfortunately, those institutions have been undermined by
the very spell that these modern apprentices have cast. The book, the
letter, the ledger, each of these has been supplanted in our modern
information infrastructure by the computer. The modern scribes are
software engineers, and their guilds are the big tech companies.
Facebook’s motto was to “move fast and break things”. Their software
engineers have done precisely that and the apprentice has robbed the
master of his powers. This is a desperate situation, and it’s getting
worse. The latest to reprise the apprentice’s role are Sam Altman and
OpenAI who dream of “general intelligence” solutions to societal
problems which OpenAI will develop, deploy, and control. Popper worried
about the threat of totalitarianism to our open societies, today’s
threat is a form of information totalitarianism which emerges from the
way these companies undermine our institutions.</p>
<p>So, what to do? If we value the open society, we must expose these
modern apprentices to scrutiny. Open development processes are critical
here, Fujitsu would never have got away with their claims of system
robustness for Horizon if the software they were using was open source.
We also need to re-empower the professions, equipping them with the
resources they need to have a critical understanding of these
technologies. That involves redesigning the interface between these
systems and the humans that empowers civil administrators to query how
they are functioning. This is a mammoth task. But recent technological
developments, such as code generation from large language models, offer
a route to delivery.</p>
<p>The open society is characterised by institutions that collaborate
with each otherin the pragmatic pursuit of solutions to social problems.
The large tech companies that have thrived because of the open society
are now putting that ecosystem in peril. For the open society to survive
it needs to embrace open development practices that enable Popper’s
piecemeal social engineers to come back together and chant “Besen,
besen! Seid’s gewesen.” Before it is too late for the master to step in
and deal with the mess the apprentice has made.</p>

<p>Figure: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies">The
Open Society and Its Enemies by Karl Popper</a> views liberal
democracies as a collection of “piecemeal social engineers” who strive
towards better outcomes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Popper opened the preface to his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="Popper-open45">(Popper, 1945)</span> with the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to
belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to
great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to
show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial
attack on freedom and reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had written the book against the background of the second world
war, his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria
in March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For Popper, the ideas of “great men” become totalitarian when imposed
on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form
of government that can allow for institutional change without bloodshed.
The open society is one characterized by institutions and individuals
that can engage in the practical pursuit of solutions to social and
political problems. The institutions are also underpinned by
individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil administrators and many more.
To Popper it is these “piecemeal social engineers” who offer pragmatic
solutions to our society’s political and social challenges.</p>

<p>Figure: A coin pusher is a game where coins are dropped into th etop

coin drop, many coins move, but it is those on the edge, who are often
only indirectly effected, but also most traumatically effected by the
change.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

<p>In the UK we saw these effects play out in the Horizon scandal: the
accounting system of the national postal service was computerized by
Fujitsu and first installed in 1999, but neither the Post Office nor
Fujitsu were able to control the system they had deployed. When it went
wrong individual sub postmasters were blamed for the systems’ errors.
Over the next two decades they were prosecuted and jailed leaving lives
ruined in the wake of the machine’s mistakes.</p>

<p><a
href="https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-jonathan-tenney">Jonathan
Tenney</a> is an Assyriologist who spends his days reading these ancient
texts. His domain of expertise is the city of Nippur, where Gilgamesh
built the great gate. The period Jonathan studies is 2,000 years after
the reign of Gilgamesh. Through his studies he can give snapshots of
life in these cities. One of these snapshots is a trial that took place
under Hammurabi’s code. The trial concerned the disappearance of an ox.
Cases were presided over by a shakannakku, normally a representative of
the king.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judgement that Adad-šuma-usur, the shakannakku gave:</p>
<p>Regarding the ox that Nergal-aha-iddina loaned to Sin-bununi and then
died in the house of Sin-bununi:</p>
<p>If Siyatu the messenger of Nergal-aha-iddina removed the corpse from
the house of Sin-bununi and then threw it to a dog, may Sin-bununi be
cleared [of wrongdoing by the ordeal] and the man of Nergal-aha-iddina
[Siyatu] be proved guilty.</p>
<p>[But] regarding the ox of Nergal-aha-iddina which died in the house
of Sin-bununi:</p>
<p>If Siyatu did not remove the corpse from the house of Sin-bununi and
instead Sin-bununi made a false accusation against Siyatu, then may the
man of Nergal-aha-iddina [i.e., Siyatu] be cleared [of wrongdoing by the
ordeal] and Sin-bununi be proved guilty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record reads almost in note form, so it might be worth a quick
review of what we think happened. Nergal-aha-iddina<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was
the original owner of an ox, which he loaned to Sin-bununi.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> When Nergal-aha-iddina wanted his ox
back, Sin-bununi said the ox had died and that Siyatu,<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Nergal-aha-iddina’s servant, had taken the corpse.</p>
<p>The case described in the tablet is unusual for two reasons. First,
the shakannakku was normally a royal proxy but in this case we are told
it was the King of Babylon himself, Adad-šuma-usur.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
Second, the judgement is for a trial by water ordeal. Someone is going
to be thrown into the river; guilt will be decided by whether the water
rejects them or absorbs them.</p>
<p>The tablet contains words, but its interpretation requires knowledge.
Jonathan<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> was kind enough to let me and my
students watch him transliterate the tablet, and as he worked he used
books, computer databases, his own expert knowledge and also his sense
of what it means to be a human. The suspicion is that Sin-bununi may
have sold the ox because his explanation of events – that the ox died
and the servant, Siyatu, came, took the body and fed it to a dog – feels
like a version of the modern ‘dog ate my homework’ excuse. The case
hinges on an accusation, but it’s one person’s word against another.</p>
<p>This judgement was passed over 3,200 years ago but, like a modern
case, making it would have involved listening to witness statements and
then coming to a decision. The choice of trial by ordeal implies that
the witness statements conflicted and the King felt he couldn’t decide
on the basis of the evidence. The trial by ordeal passes the
decision-making from the shakannakku to the gods; it’s cleromancy with
fatal implications. From the translation, it’s not quite clear who’s
going in the river … is it Siyatu the servant or Sin-bununi the accuser?
My human cynicism suspects it’s the servant that’s going to get wet.
Even over 3,000 years later, despite the different cultural landscape,
we can still imagine something about the power dynamics at play, and my
gut tells me that putting the servant through the ordeal will be the
most palatable solution to the King.</p>
<p>Sin-bununi’s story for explaining what happened to the body of the ox
reads suspiciously, but while we can speculate about what happened, we
can’t know exactly what did happen – there is uncertainty. Even at the
time of the trial, the King felt unable to make a decision, so given he
wasn’t able to establish the truth so many years ago, we’re unlikely to
find it now. This is a cold case, so cold it’s deep frozen, but anyone
reading the story can’t help but try to defrost it through the warmth of
their human understanding.</p>
<p>We may think we’ve moved beyond the idea of trial by ordeal, but I
see a similar trend emerging with our desire to use AI systems for
consequential decisions. When humans feel unable to pass judgement they
are tempted to pass the decision on to what they believe to be an
omniscient entity, but the gremlin of uncertainty means the machine is
not omniscient – putting consequential decisions on machines implies
that you will be exchanging human error for machine error. That is
problematic because the machine can never feel the consequences of those
errors as it is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as us. That is
why it’s vital the human remains in ultimate control. That’s not to say
the human should ignore the machine; rather, we would like the machine
to augment our understanding. When Amelia Earhart flew her <em>Little
Red Bus</em> she felt at one with her plane. The decisions were hers,
but they were enacted in collaboration with the machine; it was a
synergistic relationship. Perhaps a better analogy is found in Neil
Armstrong’s landing of <em>Eagle</em> on the Moon. There, a human with
the best training available was assisted by a computer and an entire
team of supportive specialists in the achievement of a goal of which all
of humanity could be proud.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in
practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of
considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of
opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality
of community is related to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called
procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em>
form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in
sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced.
It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals
may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in
tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable.
It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be
obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily
undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding
of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals
in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing
and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of
dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the
two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the
decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair
distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an
objectively correct balance between the two for any given context.
Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal
values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that
are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension
in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained
professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response
to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of
their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but
also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while
humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The atomic human emerges from limitations and vulnerabilities. It is
that shared experience that gives individual humans and their
institutions the authority to make consequential decisions about other
humans that may effect their financial status, their reputation, their
health, education or their liberty.</p>
<p>A challenge we face is that of the “sorcerer’s apprentice” where
companies have deployed capabilities that they can’t control and that
have compromised the nature of the open society.</p>
<p>As future professionals you will need to be able to wield these
capabilities and understand their weaknesses to fulfill your role in
society.</p>

<p>Donald MacKay was a physicist who worked on naval gun targetting
during the second world war. The challenge with gun targetting for ships
is that both the target and the gun platform are moving. The challenge
was tackled using analogue computers, for example in the US the <a

on radar systems for gun laying, here the velocity and distance of the

<p>Like many challenges we face today, in the second world war, fire
control was handled by a hybrid system of humans and computers. This
means deploying human beings for the tasks that they can manage, and
machines for the tasks that are better performed by a machine. This
leads to a division of labour between the machine and the human that can
still be found in our modern digital ecosystems.</p>

operation of the eye as a window on the operation of the brain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Donald MacKay was at King’s College for his PhD. He was just down the
road from Bill Phillips at LSE who was building the MONIAC. He was part
of the Ratio Club. A group of early career scientists who were
interested in communication and control in animals and humans, or more
specifically they were interested in computers and brains. The were part
of an international movement known as cybernetics.</p>
<p>Donald MacKay wrote of the influence that his own work on radar had
on his interest in the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… during the war I had worked on the theory of automated and
electronic computing and on the theory of information, all of which are
highly relevant to such things as automatic pilots and automatic gun
direction. I found myself grappling with problems in the design of
artificial sense organs for naval gun-directors and with the principles
on which electronic circuits could be used to simulate situations in the
external world so as to provide goal-directed guidance for ships,
aircraft, missiles and the like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Later in the 1940’s, when I was doing my Ph.D. work, there was much
talk of the brain as a computer and of the early digital computers that
were just making the headlines as “electronic brains.” As an analogue
computer man I felt strongly convinced that the brain, whatever it was,
was not a digital computer. I didn’t think it was an analogue computer
either in the conventional sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this naturally rubbed under my skin the question: well, if it is
not either of these, what kind of system is it? Is there any way of
following through the kind of analysis that is appropriate to their
artificial automata so as to understand better the kind of system the
human brain is? That was the beginning of my slippery slope into brain
research.</p>
<p><em>Behind the Eye</em> pg 40. Edited version of the 1986 Gifford
Lectures given by Donald M. MacKay and edited by Valerie MacKay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the <em>analogue</em>
computer and the <em>digital</em> computer. As he mentions, his
experience was with analogue machines. An analogue machine is
<em>literally</em> an analogue. The radar systems that Wiener and MacKay
both worked on were made up of electronic components such as resistors,
capacitors, inductors and/or mechanical components such as cams and
gears. Together these components could represent a physical system, such
as an anti-aircraft gun and a plane. The design of the analogue computer
required the engineer to simulate the real world in analogue
electronics, using dualities that exist between e.g. mechanical circuits
(mass, spring, damper) and electronic circuits (inductor, resistor,
capacitor). The analogy between mass and a damper, between spring and a
resistor and between capacitor and a damper works because the underlying
mathematics is approximated with the same linear system: a second order
differential equation. This mathematical analogy allowed the designer to
map from the real world, through mathematics, to a virtual world where
the components reflected the real world through analogy.</p>

<p>The machine learning systems we have built today that can reconstruct
human text, or human classification of images, necessarily must have
some aspects to them that are analagous to our understanding. As MacKay
suggests the brain is neither a digital or an analogue computer, and the
same can be said of the modern neural network systems that are being
tagged as “artificial intelligence”.</p>
<p>I believe a better term for them is “human-analogue machines”,
because what we have built is not a system that can make intelligent
decisions from first principles (a rational approach) but one that
observes how humans have made decisions through our data and
reconstructs that process. Machine learning is more empiricist than
rational, but now we n empirical approach that distils our evolved
intelligence.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the
modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction
of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the
computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>

<p>Our modern society intertwines the machine with human interactions.
The key question is who has control over these interfaces between humans
and machines.</p>
