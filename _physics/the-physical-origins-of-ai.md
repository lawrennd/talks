title: The Physical Origins of AI
abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have occurred through machine learning, an approach to combining data and assumptions about the world to form predictions. The origins of these ideas can be traced to physics. In this talk we review the historic basis of some important machine learning concepts in physics.
