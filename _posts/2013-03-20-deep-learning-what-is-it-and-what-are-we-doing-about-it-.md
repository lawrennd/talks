title: 'Deep Learning: What is it and What are We doing About it?'
abstract: |-
  In November last year, deep learning algorithms made the front page of the New York Times. What’s special about these learning algorithms? What are they being used for and how are we using them in Sheffield? In this talk I’ll explain what deep learning is, why it’s considered exciting, and what the success stories are. I’ll also explain what the problems with these learning systems and how we are trying to address these problems with our own class of deep architectures been developed in our group in Sheffield.\
