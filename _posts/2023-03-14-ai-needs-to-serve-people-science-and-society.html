<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is
not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across
society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities.</p>

<p>The NACA Langley Field proving ground tested US aircraft. Bob Gilruth

<blockquote>
<p>Hawker Hurricane airplane. A heavily armed fighter airplane noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane’s flying qualities were
found to be generally satisfactory. The most notable deficiencies were
heavy aileron forces at high speeds and large friction in the
controls.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supermarine Spitfire airplane. A high-performance fighter noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain and throughout WW II, the Spitfire had
desirably light elevator control forces in maneuvers and near neutral
longitudinal stability. Its greatest deficiency from the combat
standpoint was heavy aileron forces and sluggish roll response at high
speeds.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilruth went beyond the reports of feel to characterise how the plane
should respond to different inputs on the control stick. In other words
he quantified that feel of the plane.</p>
<p>Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology
design.</p>
<p>Building this pipeline will take coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.</p>
<h2 id="making-ai-equitable">Making AI equitable</h2>
<p>AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address
these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective
AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across
research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from
affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled
innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.</p>
<p>This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s
vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form
partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected
communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new
platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver
innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students,
researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between
the University and national AI priorities.</p>
<p>The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation
and steward of those innovations.</p>
<p>AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and
practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal
benefit and mitigate social harm.</p>
<p>In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of
Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and
maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research
ecosystem.</p>

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in
practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of
considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of
opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality
of community is related to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called
procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em>
form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in
sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced.
It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals
may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in
tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable.
It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be
obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily
undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding
of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals
in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing
and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of
dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the
two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the
decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair
distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an
objectively correct balance between the two for any given context.
Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal
values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that
are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension
in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained
professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response
to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of
their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but
also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while
humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have
an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the
human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning, but
need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field machine
learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle some complex,
‘real world’ problems.</p>
<p>It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has started
the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new Programme is
seeking to support researchers across the University to develop the
skills they need to be able to use machine learning and AI in their
research.</p>
<p>To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops and
applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific challenges,
with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on issues
relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While
we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for now, in the longer term our
ambition is to build links with the social sciences and
humanities.</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a pipeline
of learning opportunities to help PhD students and postdocs better
understand how to use data science and machine learning in their work.
Our programme with Spark is one element of this, and we’ll be announcing
further activities soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on machine
learning and the sciences, helping to share best practice and new
methods, and support each other in advancing their research. Over the
coming years, we’ll be running a variety of events and activities in
support of this, and would welcome your ideas about what might be most
useful.</p></li>

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated
decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data
there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but
also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for
targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to
identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual
selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The feudal system that is implied by current data protection
legislation has significant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the
data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data
subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too
late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often
their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but
that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>

and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a
potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em>
that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to
the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organization
where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees’
responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the
motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the
data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under
which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would
be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of
individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the
Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded
with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily
involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems
clear that we need to better characterize the data sharing landscape as
well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data
sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it
feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be
taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider
negotiations.</p>
