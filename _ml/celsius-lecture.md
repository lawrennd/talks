title: "Innovation to Deployment"
subtitle: Machine Learning Systems Design
abstract: >
  The AI systems we are developing and deploying are based on
  interconnected machine learning components. This proposal focuses on 
  AI-assisted design and monitoring of these systems to ensure they perform
  robustly, safely and accurately in their deployed environment. We address 
  the entire pipeline of AI system development, from data acquisition to 
  decision making. 
  
  We propose an ecosystem that includes system monitoring for performance, 
  interpretability and fairness. We place these ideas in a wider context 
  that also considers the availability, quality and ethics of data.

Yes, something like that is a good idea. I’m going to start a small document.

22nd sounds sensible.

I think bringing together the Accelerate, Turing and McGovern work could be interesting. Putting together under a theme … maybe that is supply chain of ideas. But need to relate that to passage of information and perhaps the role for ML in society??

How about I send out an invite for the afternoon of 22 January? (Give you a week or so of adjusting to term starting, but 3 weeks to make changes before the event?)
 
Also happy to kick around ideas before that, if useful. Feels like you could tie together intellectual debt and supply chain of ideas (what happens when you speed up the pace of coconut production?) and the characteristics you need for AI systems to work well with people.

Yes, good idea. 
 
Let’s get a target date for the test run in (I’m still not 100% sure what to talk about!)

Oooo! I was thinking about this the other day – we could do a test run on this with the group. Sort of a dress rehearsal, if you want to try out different lines or ideas? But also a way of contributing to the process of introducing ML@CL and Accelerate to each other.

Hi Neil, 
 
We have a new initiative here at the university AI4Research where the focus is on developing AI/ML and in particular the use of AI/ML at a tool to develop other disciplines (medicine, physics, chemistry, etc.). Some background on the project is available here https://uu.se/en/research/ai4research/  and when I was asked to write about the ideas it resulted in this
https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/news/article/?id=14730&typ=artikel&lang=en
 
If you like these ideas and have a story that somehow aligns with this that would be great. However, I definitely do not want to force you into talking about this topic, I only mentioning it since you asked for some concrete ideas.
 
In any case, it is important that your talk is broadly accessible to a wide audience (Technology and Natural Science) at the same time as it remains scientific, which is of course the challenge with talks of this kind. 
 
Hope this can be of some help?
 
Best,
Thomas

It would be great to have a sense of what you’d prefer me to talk about. I can imagine a few different things, but if I have a good steer from yourself, I’d be happy to use that!

Hi Neil,  
 
Just let me know if you want to discuss title, abstract or anything else related to your talk at this stage.
 
Cheers,
Thomas

Dear Niel
 
Glad to hear that!
 
When you have the time, you can send me a picture of you and a short biography. If you already know the title of your lecture, you can send that to me as well.  
 
My very best regards
Karin Thellenberg

Dear Neil
 
It is our pleasure to officially invite you to act as the Celsius lecturer of the Celsius-Linnaeus lectures 2021. Attached you’ll find the Official invitation letter with more information about the lecturers and the whole program. 
 
Regarding if we will have the lectures in Uppsala or online, we will decide that based on the health authority recommendations, the university policies in Uppsala and your university some time in early January. However, for the time being, the event I scheduled to be held in Uppsala. 
 
We have a webpage for the Celsius-Linnaeus lectures and we hand out a program to the audience so right now I’ll need a picture of you, the title of your lecture and a short biography.
 
If you have any questions don’t hesitate to contact me or Thomas Schön.
 
My very best regards
Karin Thellenberg
