title: Approximate Inference in Deep GPs
abstract: |
  In this talk we will review deep Gaussian process models and relate them
  to neural network models. We will then consider the details of how
  variational inference may be performed in these models. The approach is
  centred on “variational compression”, an approach to variational
  inference that compresses information into an augmented variable space.
  The aim of the deep Gaussian process framework is to enable
  probabilistic learning of multi-modal data. We will therefore end by
  highlighting directions for future research and discussing application
  of these models in domains such as personalised health.
