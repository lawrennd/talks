title: "The Atomic Human"
subtitle: What makes us unique in the age of AI
abstract: |
  By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
  Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and
  limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
  by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or
  we become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose
  the future we want.

  The book reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded; not just by the experts, but also ordinary people.

  An informal reception will follow the talk.
