title: "Use or be Used: Regaining Control of AI"
venue: "Strachey Lecture, Oxford"
abstract: "<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster
horse”. If Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what
would the customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the
picture of machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives,
but the reality of what we’ve developed is far more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Much of the debate
around AI makes the mistake of seeing machine intelligence as a
reflection of our intelligence. In this talk we argue that to control
the machine we need to understand the machine, but to understand the
machine we first need to understand ourselves.</p>"
