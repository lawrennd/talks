abstract: In the second part of this tutorial we will develop non linear approaches
  to dimensionality reduction from the probabilistic perspective. Firstly we will
  briefly review a probabilistic perspectives on spectral approaches, and then we
  will build on the non-linear approaches we derived using Gaussian processes in the
  first part of the tutorial.
