title: A Unifying Probabilistic Perspective on Spectral Approaches to Dimensionality
  Reduction
abstract: Spectral approaches to dimensionality reduction typically reduce the dimensionality
  of a data set through taking the eigenvectors of a Laplacian or a similarity matrix.
  Classical multidimensional scaling also makes use of the eigenvectors of a similarity
  matrix. In this talk we introduce a maximum entropy approach to designing this similarity
  matrix. The approach is closely related to maximum variance unfolding. Other spectral
  approaches such as locally linear embeddings and Laplacian eigenmaps also turn out
  to be closely related. Each method can be seen as a sparse Gaussian graphical model
  where correlations between data points (rather than across data features) are specified
  in the graph. This also suggests optimization via sparse inverse covariance techniques
  such as the graphical LASSO. The hope is that this unifying perspective will allow
  the relationships between these methods to be better understood and will also provide
  the groundwork for further research.
