    "### The Paradox of Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions\n",
    "of individuals in society, and this might lead us to believe that social\n",
    "science, politics, economics are becoming quantifiable. We are able to\n",
    "get a far richer characterization of the world around us. Paradoxically\n",
    "it seems that as we measure more, we understand less.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could this be possible? It may be that the greater preponderance of\n",
    "data is making society itself more complex. Therefore traditional\n",
    "approaches to measurement (e.g. polling by random sub sampling) are\n",
    "becoming harder, for example due to more complex batch effects, a\n",
    "greater stratification of society where it is more difficult to weigh\n",
    "the various sub-populations correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is that we have a Curate’s egg of a society: it is only\n",
    "‘measured in parts.’ Whether by examination of social media or through\n",
    "polling we no longer obtain the overall picture that can be necessary to\n",
    "obtain the depth of understanding we require.\n",
    "\n",
    "[One example of this\n",
    "phenomenon](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate)\n",
    "is the 2015 UK election which polls had as a tie and yet in practice was\n",
    "won by the Conservative party with a seven point advantage. A\n",
    "post-election poll which was truly randomized suggested that this lead\n",
    "was measurable, but pre-election polls are conducted on line and via\n",
    "phone. These approaches can under represent certain sectors. The\n",
    "challenge is that the truly randomized poll is expensive and time\n",
    "consuming. In practice on line and phone polls are usually weighted to\n",
    "reflect the fact that they are not truly randomized, but in a rapidly\n",
    "evolving society the correct weights may move faster than they can be\n",
    "tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is clinical trials. Once again they are the preserve of\n",
    "randomized studies to verify the efficacy of the drug. But now, rather\n",
    "than population becoming more stratified, it is the more personalized\n",
    "nature of the drugs we wish to test. A targeted drug which has efficacy\n",
    "in a sub-population may be harder to test due to difficulty in\n",
    "recruiting the sub-population, the benefit of the drug is also for a\n",
    "smaller sub-group, so expense of drug trials increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other less clear cut manifestations of this phenomenon. We\n",
    "seem to rely increasingly on social media as a news source, or as a\n",
    "indicator of opinion on a particular subject. But it is beholden to the\n",
    "whims of a vocal minority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the way we required more paper when we first developed the\n",
    "computer, the solution is more *classical* statistics. We need to do\n",
    "more work to verify the tentative conclusions we produce so that we know\n",
    "that our new methodologies are effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we increase the amount of data we acquire, we seem to be able to get\n",
    "better at characterizing the actions of individuals, predicting how they\n",
    "will behave. But we seem, somehow, to be becoming less capable at\n",
    "understanding society. Somehow it seems that as we measure more, we\n",

    "\n",
