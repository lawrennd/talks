title: "The Atomic Human"
subtitle: "Understanding ourselves in the age of AI"
abstract: |
  Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the centre of the world.
