### Background: Big Data

* The pervasiveness of data brings forward particular challenges.

* Those challenges are most sharply in focus for personalized health.

* Particular opportunities, in challenging areas such as *mental health*.

### Evolved Relationship

### Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.

* Great *promise* for personalized health.

### Societal Effects

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.

* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data.

* Particularly important where treatments are being prescribed.

* But what is a treatment in the modern era: interventions could be far more subtle.

### Societal Effects

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer

* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science


### Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization

### Also need

* More classical statistics!
    * Like the 'paperless office'

* A better characterization of human (see later)

* Larger studies (100,000 genome)
    * Combined with complex models: algorithmic challenges

\include{../_privacy/includes/differential-privacy-for-gps.md}
\include{../_privacy/includes/differential-privacy-with-cloaking.md}

### Awareness

* Need to increase awareness of the pitfalls among researchers
* Need to ensure that technological solutions are being delivered not merely for few (#FirstWorldProblems)
* Address a wider set of challenges that the greater part of the world's population is facing

### Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise for personalized health
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them
* Need new ways of thinking! 
* *Mathematical* Data Science

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**
