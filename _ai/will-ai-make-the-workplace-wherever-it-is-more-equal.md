title: Will AI Make the Workplace - Wherever it is- More Equal?
abstract: >
  COVID-19 has brought more flexible working, particularly
  homeworking, for many. Will those changes be sustained after the
  pandemic and allow previously excluded workers into the labour
  market? And how will the artificial intelligence revolution affect
  the jobs we do and who does them? With Drs Christopher Markou, Helen
  McCarthy, Neil Lawrence and Stella Pachidi.

  This event is taking place in partnership with The Hay Festival
