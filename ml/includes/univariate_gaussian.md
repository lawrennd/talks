### The Gaussian Density

-   Perhaps the most common probability density.

    $$\begin{align}
    p(\dataScalar| \meanScalar, \dataStd^2) & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\dataStd^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{(\dataScalar - \meanScalar)^2}{2\dataStd^2}\right)\\& \buildrel\triangle\over = \gaussianDist{\dataScalar}{\meanScalar}{\dataStd^2}
    \end{align}$$

-   The Gaussian density.

</object>

The Gaussian PDF with ${\mu}=1.7$ and variance ${\sigma}^2=
  0.0225$. Mean shown as cyan line. It could represent the heights of a
population of students.

### Gaussian Density {#gaussian-density}

<large>
$$
\gaussianDist{\dataScalar}{\meanScalar}{\dataStd^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\dataStd^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\dataScalar-\meanScalar)^2}{2\dataStd^2}\right)
$$
$\dataStd^2$ is the variance of the density and $\meanScalar$ is the mean.
