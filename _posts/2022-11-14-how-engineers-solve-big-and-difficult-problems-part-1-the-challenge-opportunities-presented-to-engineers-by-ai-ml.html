title: "How Engineers Solve Big and Difficult Problems Part 1: The
Challenges/Opportunities Presented to Engineers by AI/ML"
venue: "The Engineer in Society"
abstract: "<p>Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on
deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in
“artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines and
is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda. In this talk
I will give an overview of where we are now with machine learning
solutions, and what challenges we face both in the near and far future.
These include practical application of existing algorithms in the face
of the need to explain decision making, mechanisms for improving the
quality and availability of data, dealing with large unstructured
datasets.</p>"

<p>As an exercise in understanding complexity, watch the following
video. You will see the basketball being bounced around, and the players
moving. Your job is to count the passes of those dressed in white and
ignore those of the individuals dressed in black.</p>

<p>Figure: Daniel Simon’s famous illusion “monkey business”. Focus on
the movement of the ball distracts the viewer from seeing other aspects
of the image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a classic study <span class="citation"
data-cites="Simons-gorillas99">Simons and Chabris (1999)</span> ask
subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players
on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these
subjects don’t notice the gorilla moving across the scene.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their
paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö
Bálint,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything
happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of
something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such
an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral
parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive
completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low
bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we
perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other
(potentially vital) contextual information.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as selective attention or ‘inattentional
blindness’.</p>

<p>We are going to see how inattention biases can play out in data
analysis by going through a simple example. The analysis involves body
mass index and activity information.</p>

</div>
<p>The BMI Steps example is taken from <span class="citation"
data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">Yanai and Lercher (2020)</span>. We are
given a data set of body-mass index measurements against step counts.
For convenience we have packaged the data so that it can be easily
downloaded.</p>

<p>It is good practice to give our variables interpretable names so that
the analysis may be clearly understood by others. Here the
<code>steps</code> count is the first dimension of the covariate, the
<code>bmi</code> is the second dimension and the <code>gender</code> is
stored in <code>y</code> with <code>1</code> for female and
<code>0</code> for male.</p>

<p>We can also separate out the means from the male and female
populations. In python this can be done by setting male and female
indices as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_ind <span class="op">=</span> (gender<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">0</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_ind <span class="op">=</span> (gender<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now we can extract the variables for the two populations.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_steps <span class="op">=</span> steps[male_ind]</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_bmi <span class="op">=</span> bmi[male_ind]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And as before we compute the mean.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Male steps mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>male_steps.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Similarly, we can get the same result for the female portion of the
populaton.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_steps <span class="op">=</span> steps[female_ind]</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_bmi <span class="op">=</span> bmi[female_ind]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Female steps mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>female_steps.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Interesting, the female BMI average is slightly higher than the male
BMI average. The number of steps in the male group is higher than that
in the female group. Perhaps the steps and the BMI are anti-correlated.
The more steps, the lower the BMI.</p>
<p>Python provides a statistics package. We’ll import this in
<code>python</code> so that we can try and understand the correlation
between the <code>steps</code> and the <code>BMI</code>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothesis-as-a-liability">A Hypothesis as a Liability</h2>
<p>This analysis is from an article titled “A Hypothesis as a Liability”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">(Yanai and
Lercher, 2020)</span>, they start their article with the following quite
from Herman Hesse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that
his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find
nothing, to take in nothing. […] Seeking means: having a goal. But
finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking.
However, in answer to their paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Felin-data20">Felin et al. (2021)</span> argue that some
form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis
<em>can</em> be a liability</p>
<p>My view is captured in the introductory chapter to an edited volume
on computational systems biology that I worked on with Mark Girolami,
Magnus Rattray and Guido Sanguinetti.</p>

<p>Popper nicely captures the interaction between hypothesis and data by
relating it to the chicken and the egg. The important thing is that
these two co-evolve.</p>
<h2 id="number-theatre">Number Theatre</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have time to wait for this process to
converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is
required.</p>
<p>Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but
sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision.
David Spiegelhalter refers to the phenomenon of “Number Theatre” in a
conversation with Andrew Marr from May 2020 on the presentation of
data.</p>

<h2 id="data-theatre">Data Theatre</h2>
<p>Data Theatre exploits data inattention bias to present a particular
view on events that may misrepresents through selective presentation.
Statisticians are one of the few groups that are trained with a
sufficient degree of data skepticism. But it can also be combatted
through ensuring there are domain experts present, and that they can
speak freely.</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is
a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model}
\stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or
passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our
assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other
data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our
beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models
include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be
taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine
learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the
importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the
model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions.
To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> it is used to make the
predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the
universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g., smoothness,
spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> it defines the ‘cost’ of
misprediction. Typically, it includes knowledge about the world’s
generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for
mispredictions (empirical risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and
the objective function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class
of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is
restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or
the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find
an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the academic field of machine
learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring
different types of models and data together.</p>
<p>A useful reference for state of the art in machine learning is the UK
Royal Society Report, <a

<p>Machine learning technologies have been the driver of two related,
but distinct disciplines. The first is <em>data science</em>. Data
science is an emerging field that arises from the fact that we now
collect so much data by happenstance, rather than by <em>experimental
design</em>. Classical statistics is the science of drawing conclusions
from data, and to do so statistical experiments are carefully designed.
In the modern era we collect so much data that there’s a desire to draw
inferences directly from the data.</p>
<p>As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from
statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data),
visualization and data mining.</p>
<p>In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on
emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image,
or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent
advances in artificial intelligence have come from machine learning
providing the automation. But in contrast to data science, in artificial
intelligence the data is normally collected with the specific task in
mind. In this sense it has strong relations to classical statistics.</p>
<p>Classically artificial intelligence worried more about <em>logic</em>
and <em>planning</em> and focused less on data driven decision making.
Modern machine learning owes more to the field of <em>Cybernetics</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="Wiener:cybernetics48">(Wiener,
1948)</span> than artificial intelligence. Related fields include
<em>robotics</em>, <em>speech recognition</em>, <em>language
understanding</em> and <em>computer vision</em>.</p>
<p>There are strong overlaps between the fields, the wide availability
of data by happenstance makes it easier to collect data for designing AI
systems. These relations are coming through wide availability of sensing
technologies that are interconnected by cellular networks, WiFi and the
internet. This phenomenon is sometimes known as the <em>Internet of
Things</em>, but this feels like a dangerous misnomer. We must never
forget that we are interconnecting people, not things.</p>

<p>We have already seen the effects of this changed dynamic in biology
and computational biology. Improved sensorics have led to the new
domains of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and ‘rich phenomics’ as well as
considerably augmenting our capabilities in genomics.</p>
<p>Biologists have had to become data-savvy, they require a rich
understanding of the available data resources and need to assimilate
existing data sets in their hypothesis generation as well as their
experimental design. Modern biology has become a far more quantitative
science, but the quantitativeness has required new methods developed in
the domains of <em>computational biology</em> and
<em>bioinformatics</em>.</p>
<p>There is also great promise for personalized health, but in health
the wide data-sharing that has underpinned success in the computational
biology community is much harder to carry out.</p>
<p>We can expect to see these phenomena reflected in wider society.
Particularly as we make use of more automated decision making based only
on data. This is leading to a requirement to better understand our own
subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface allows
domain experts to assimilate data driven conclusions in a well
calibrated manner. This is particularly important where medical
treatments are being prescribed. It also offers potential for different
kinds of medical intervention. More subtle interventions are possible
when the digital environment is able to respond to users in an bespoke
manner. This has particular implications for treatment of mental health
conditions.</p>
<p>The main phenomenon we see across the board is the shift in dynamic
from the direct pathway between human and data, as traditionally
mediated by classical statistics, to a new flow of information via the
computer. This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging
domain of <em>data science</em>, where the interactions between human
and data are mediated by the machine.</p>

challenges have social implications but require technological advance
for their solutions.</p>

<p>The big data paradox is the modern phenomenon of “as we collect more
data, we understand less”. It is emerging in several domains, political
polling, characterization of patients for trials data, monitoring
twitter for political sentiment.</p>
<p>I like to think of the phenomenon as relating to the notion of “can’t
see the wood for the trees”. Classical statistics, with randomized
controlled trials, improved society’s understanding of data. It improved
our ability to monitor the forest, to consider population health, voting
patterns etc. It is critically dependent on active approaches to data
collection that deal with confounders. This data collection can be very
expensive.</p>
<p>In business today, it is still the gold standard, A/B tests are used
to understand the effect of an intervention on revenue or customer
capture or supply chain costs.</p>

<p>The new phenomenon is <em>happenstance data</em>. Data that is not
actively collected with a question in mind. As a result, it can mislead
us. For example, if we assume the politics of active users of twitter is
reflective of the wider population’s politics, then we may be
misled.</p>
<p>However, this happenstance data often allows us to characterise a
particular individual to a high degree of accuracy. Classical statistics
was all about the forest, but big data can often become about the
individual tree. As a result we are misled about the situation.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is more dangerous, because our perception is that we
are characterizing the wider scenario with ever increasing accuracy.
Whereas we are just becoming distracted by detail that may or may not be
pertinent to the wider situation.</p>
<p>This is related to our limited bandwidth as humans, and the ease with
which we are distracted by detail. The
data-inattention-cognitive-bias.</p>
<h2 id="breadth-or-depth-paradox">Breadth or Depth Paradox</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">

</div>
<p>The first challenge we’d like to highlight is the unusual paradoxes
of the data society. It is too early to determine whether these
paradoxes are fundmental or transient. Evidence for them is still
somewhat anecdotal, but they seem worthy of further attention.</p>
<h3 id="the-paradox-of-measurement">The Paradox of Measurement</h3>
<p>We are now able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the
actions of individuals in society, and this might lead us to believe
that social science, politics, economics are becoming quantifiable. We
are able to get a far richer characterization of the world around us.
Paradoxically it seems that as we measure more, we understand less.</p>
<p>How could this be possible? It may be that the greater preponderance
of data is making society itself more complex. Therefore traditional
approaches to measurement (e.g. polling by random sub sampling) are
becoming harder, for example due to more complex batch effects, a
greater stratification of society where it is more difficult to weigh
the various sub-populations correctly.</p>
<p>The end result is that we have a Curate’s egg of a society: it is
only ‘measured in parts’. Whether by examination of social media or
through polling we no longer obtain the overall picture that can be
necessary to obtain the depth of understanding we require.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate">One
example of this phenomenon</a> is the 2015 UK election which polls had
as a tie and yet in practice was won by the Conservative party with a
seven point advantage. A post-election poll which was truly randomized
suggested that this lead was measurable, but pre-election polls are
conducted on line and via phone. These approaches can under represent
certain sectors. The challenge is that the truly randomized poll is
expensive and time consuming. In practice on line and phone polls are
usually weighted to reflect the fact that they are not truly randomized,
but in a rapidly evolving society the correct weights may move faster
than they can be tracked.</p>
<p>Another example is clinical trials. Once again they are the preserve
of randomized studies to verify the efficacy of the drug. But now,
rather than population becoming more stratified, it is the more
personalized nature of the drugs we wish to test. A targeted drug which
has efficacy in a sub-population may be harder to test due to difficulty
in recruiting the sub-population, the benefit of the drug is also for a
smaller sub-group, so expense of drug trials increases.</p>
<p>There are other less clear cut manifestations of this phenomenon. We
seem to rely increasingly on social media as a news source, or as a
indicator of opinion on a particular subject. But it is beholden to the
whims of a vocal minority.</p>
<p>Similar to the way we required more paper when we first developed the
computer, the solution is more <em>classical</em> statistics. We need to
do more work to verify the tentative conclusions we produce so that we
know that our new methodologies are effective.</p>
<p>As we increase the amount of data we acquire, we seem to be able to
get better at characterizing the actions of individuals, predicting how
they will behave. But we seem, somehow, to be becoming less capable at
understanding society. Somehow it seems that as we measure more, we
understand less.</p>
<p>That seems counter-intuitive. But perhaps the preponderance of data
is making society itself, or the way we measure society, somehow more
complex. And in turn, this means that traditional approaches to
measurement are failing. So when we realize we are getting better at
characterising individuals, perhaps we are only measuring society in
parts.</p>
<h2 id="breadth-vs-depth">Breadth vs Depth</h2>
<p>Classical approaches to data analysis made use of many subjects to
achieve statistical power. Traditionally, we measure a few things about
many people. For example cardiac disease risks can be based on a limited
number of factors inmany patients (such as whether the patient smokes,
blood pressure, cholesterol levels etc). Because, traditionally, data
matrices are stored with individuals in rows and features in columns<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, we refer to this as <em>depth</em>
of measurement. In statistics this is sometimes known as the <em>large
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, small <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span></em> domain because traditionally <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is used to denote the number of
features we know about an individual and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is used to denote the number of
individuals.</p>
<p>The data-revolution is giving us access to far more detail about each
individual, this is leading to a <em>breadth</em> of coverage. This
characteristic first came to prominence in computational biology and
genomics where we became able to record information about mutations and
transcription in millions of genes. So <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> became very large, but due to expense
of measurement, the number of patients recorded, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, was relatively small. But we now see
this increasingly for other domains. With an increasing number of
sensors on our wrists or in our mobile phones, we are characterizing
indivdiuals in unprecedented detail. This domain can also be effectively
dealt with by modifying the models that are used for the data.</p>
<!-- https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Grib_skov.jpg-->
<p>So we can know an individual extremely well, or we can know a
population well. The saying “Can’t see the wood for the trees”, means we
are distracted by the individual trees in a forest, and can’t see the
wider context. This seems appropriate for what may be going on here. We
are becoming distracted by the information on the individual and we
can’t see the wider context of the data.</p>
<p>We know that a rigorous, randomized, study would characterize that
forest well, but it seems we are unwilling to invest the money required
to do that and the proxies we are using are no longer effective, perhaps
because of shifting patterns of behaviour driven by the rapidly evolving
digital world.</p>
<p>Further, it’s likely that we are interested in <em>strata</em> within
our data set. Equivalent to the structure within the forest: a clearing,
a transition between types of tree, a shift in the nature of the
undergrowth.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Examples exhibiting this phenomenon include recent elections, which
have proven difficult to predict. Including, the UK 2015 elections, the
EU referendum, the US 2016 elections and the UK 2017 elections. In each
case individuals may have taken actions on the back of polls that showed
one thing or another but turned out to be inaccurate. Indeed, the only
accurate pre-election poll for the UK 2017 election, <a
href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/05/31/how-yougov-model-2017-general-election-works/">the
YouGov poll</a>, was not a traditional poll, it contains a new type of
statistical model called <a
href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/10/09/mister-p-whats-its-secret-sauce/">Multilevel
Regression and Poststratification (MRP)</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Gelman:multilevel06">(Gelman and Hill, 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Another example is stratified medicine. If a therapy is effective
only in a sub-type of a disease, then statistical power can be lost
across the whole population, particularly when that sub-type is a
minority. But characterization of that sub-type is difficult. For
example, new cancer immunotherapy treatments can have a dramatic effect,
leading to almost total elimination of the cancer in some patients, but
characterizing this sub-population is hard. This also makes it hard to
develop clinical trials that prove the efficacy of the drugs.</p>
<p>A final example is our measurement of our economy, which increasingly
may not capture where value is being generated. This is characterized by
the changing nature of work, and the way individuals contribute towards
society. For example, the open source community has driven the backbone
of the majority of operating system software we use today, as well as
cloud compute. But this value is difficult to measure as it was
contributed by volunteers, not by a traditional corporate structure.
Data itself may be driving this change, because the value of data
accumulates in a similar way to the value of capital. The movement of
data in the economy, and the value it generates is also hard to measure,
and it seems there may be a large class of “have nots”, in terms of
those industries whose productivity has suffered relative to the top
performers. The so-called productivity gap may not just be due to skills
and infrastructure, but also due to data-skills and
data-infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h2>
<p>The nature of the digital society has a closed loop feedback on
itself. This is characterized by social media memes, which focus
attention on particular issues very quickly. A good example being the
photograph of Aylan Kurdi, the young Syrian boy found drowned on a
Turkish beach. This photograph had a dramatic effect on attitudes
towards immigration, more than the statistics that were showing that
thousands were dieing in the Mediterranean each month (see <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnydewwtido6nhv/VISSOCMEDLAB_AYLAN%20KURDI%20REPORT.pdf?dl=0">this
report by the University of Sheffield’s Social Media Lab</a>).
Similarly, the changed dynamics of our social circles. Filter bubbles,
where our searches and/or newsfeed has been personalized to things that
algorithms already know we like. Echo chambers, where we interact mainly
with people we agree with and our opinions aren’t challenged. Each of
these is changing the dynamic of society, and yet there is a strong
temptation to use digital media for surveying information.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>The solutions to these challenges come in three flavours. Firstly,
there is a need for more data. In particular data that is actively
acquired to cover the gaps in our knowledge. We also need more use of
classical statistical techniques, and a wider understanding of what they
involve. This situation reminds me somewhat of the idea of the
‘paperless office’. The innovative research at Xerox PARC that brought
us the Graphical User Interface, so prevalent today, was driven by the
realization, in the 1970s that eventually offices would stop using
paper. Xerox focussed research on what that office would look like as it
was a perceived threat to their business. The paperless office may still
come, but in practice computers brought about a significant increase in
the need for paper due to the additional amounts of information that
they caused to be summarized or generated. In a similar way, the world
of <em>big data</em> is driving a need for more experimental design and
more classical statistics. Any perception of the automated computer
algorithm that drives all before it is at least as far away as the
paperless office was in the 1970s.</p>
<p>We also need a better social, cognitive and biological understanding
of humans and how we and our social structures respond to these
interventions. Over time some of the measurables will likely stabilize,
but it is not yet clear which ones.</p>

<p>The big data paradox has a sister: the big model paradox. As we build
more and more complex models, we start believing that we have a
high-fidelity representation of reality. But the complexity of reality
is way beyond our feeble imaginings. So we end up with a highly complex
model, but one that falls well short in terms of reflecting reality. The
complexity of the model means that it moves beyond our
understanding.</p>

desalination before it can be consumed. But like real desalination, this

<p>I spoke about the challenges in data science at the NIPS 2016
Workshop on Machine Learning for Health. NIPS mainly focuses on machine
learning methodologies, and many of the speakers were doing so. But
before my talk, I listened to some of the other speakers talk about the
challenges they had with data preparation.</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony
Celi)</li>
<li>“The Dirty Work We Don’t Want to Think About” (Eric Xing)</li>
<li>“Voodoo to get it decompressed” (Francisco Giminez)</li>
</ul>
<p>A further challenge in healthcare is that the data is collected by
clinicians, often at great inconvenience to both themselves and the
patient, but the control of the data is sometimes used to steer the
direction of research.</p>
<p>The fact that we put so much effort into processing the data, but so
little into allocating credit for this work is a major challenge for
realizing the benefit in the data we have.</p>
<p>This type of work is somewhat thankless, with the exception of the
clinicians’ control of the data, which probably takes things too far,
those that collate and correct data sets gain little credit. In the
domain of <em>reinforcement learning</em> the aim is to take a series of
actions to achieve a stated goal and gain a reward. The <em>credit
assignment problem</em> is the challenge in the learning algorithm of
distributing credit to each of the actions which brought about the
reward. We also experience this problem in society, we use proxies such
as monetary reward to incentivise intermediate steps in our economy.
Modern society functions because we agree to make basic expenditure on
infrastructure, such as roads, which we all make use of. Our
data-society is not sufficiently mature to be correctly crediting and
rewarding those that undertake this work.</p>
<p>This situation is no better in industry than in academia. Many
companies have been persuaded to accumulate all their data centrally in
a so-called “data lake”. This attractive idea is problematic, because
data is added to the “lake” without thought to its quality. As a result,
a better name for these resources would be data swamps. Because the
quality of data in them is often dubious. Data scientists when working
with these sources often need to develop their own processes for
checking the quality of the data before it is used. Unfortunately, the
quality improvements they make are rarely fed back into the ecosystem,
meaning the same purification work needs to be done repeatedly.</p>
<p>We need to properly incentivize the sharing and production of clean
data sets, we need to correctly quantify the value in the contribution
of each actor, otherwise there won’t be enough clean data to satiate the
thirst of our decision-making processes.</p>

<p>The value of shared data infrastructures in computational biology was
recognized by the 2010 joint statement from the Wellcome Trust and other
funders of research at the “Foggy Bottom” meeting. They recognised three
key benefits to sharing of health data:</p>
<ul>
<li>faster progress in improving health</li>
<li>better value for money</li>
<li>higher quality science</li>
</ul>
<p>But incentivising sharing requires incentivising collection and
collation of data, and the associated credit allocation models.</p>

<p>Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate
stages of data graduation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade C - accessibility
<ul>
<li>Transition: data becomes electronically available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade B - validity
<ul>
<li>Transition: pose a question to the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade A - usability</li>
</ul>
<p>The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade
C data to Grade B data is delimited by the <em>electronic
availability</em> of the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is
delimited by posing a question or task to the data <span
class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence-drl17">(Lawrence,
2017)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-grade-c">Accessibility: Grade C</h2>
<p>The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data
science practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who,
perhaps having had little experience of data-science before, state that
they “have the data”. More often than not, they have not verified this.
A convenient term for this is “Hearsay Data”, someone has <em>heard</em>
that they have the data so they <em>say</em> they have it. This is the
lowest grade of data readiness.</p>
<p>Progressing through Grade C involves ensuring that this data is
accessible. Not just in terms of digital accessiblity, but also for
regulatory, ethical and intellectual property reasons.</p>
<h2 id="validity-grade-b">Validity: Grade B</h2>
<p>Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital
analysis on the computer. Once the challenges of access to the data have
been resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for
direct loading into analysis software (such as Python, R, Matlab,
Mathematica or SPSS). Once this has occured the data is at B4 level.
Grade B involves the <em>validity</em> of the data. Does the data really
represent what it purports to? There are challenges such as missing
values, outliers, record duplication. Each of these needs to be
investigated.</p>
<p>Grade B and C are important as if the work done in these grades is
documented well, it can be reused in other projects. Reuse of this
labour is key to reducing the costs of data-driven automated decision
making. There is a strong overlap between the work required in this
grade and the statistical field of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"><em>exploratory
data analysis</em></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tukey:exploratory77">(Tukey, 1977)</span>.</p>
<p>The need for Grade B emerges due to the fundamental change in the
availability of data. Classically, the scientific question came first,
and the data came later. This is still the approach in a randomized
control trial, e.g. in A/B testing or clinical trials for drugs. Today
data is being laid down by happenstance, and the question we wish to ask
about the data often comes after the data has been created. The Grade B
of data readiness ensures thought can be put into data quality
<em>before</em> the question is defined. It is this work that is
reusable across multiple teams. It is these processes that the team
which is <em>standing up</em> the data must deliver.</p>
<h2 id="usability-grade-a">Usability: Grade A</h2>
<p>Once the validity of the data is determined, the data set can be
considered for use in a particular task. This stage of data readiness is
more akin to what machine learning scientists are used to doing in
universities. Bringing an algorithm to bear on a well understood data
set.</p>
<p>In Grade A we are concerned about the utility of the data given a
particular task. Grade A may involve additional data collection
(experimental design in statistics) to ensure that the task is
fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is the stage where the data and the model are brought together,
so expertise in learning algorithms and their application is key.
Further ethical considerations, such as the fairness of the resulting
predictions are required at this stage. At the end of this stage a
prototype model is ready for deployment.</p>
<p>Deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in production
is another important issue which Data Readiness Levels are only a part
of the solution for.</p>

<p>Throughout the data preparation pipeline, it is important to have
close interaction between data scientists and application domain
experts. Decisions on data preparation taken outside the context of
application have dangerous downstream consequences. This provides an
additional burden on the data scientist as they are required for each
project, but it should also be seen as a learning and familiarization
exercise for the domain expert. Long term, just as biologists have found
it necessary to assimilate the skills of the bioinformatician to be
effective in their science, most domains will also require a familiarity
with the nature of data driven decision making and its application.
Working closely with data-scientists on data preparation is one way to
begin this sharing of best practice.</p>
<p>The processes involved in Grade C and B are often badly taught in
courses on data science. Perhaps not due to a lack of interest in the
areas, but maybe more due to a lack of access to real world examples
where data quality is poor.</p>
<p>These stages of data science are also ridden with ambiguity. In the
long term they could do with more formalization, and automation, but
best practice needs to be understood by a wider community before that
can happen.</p>

<p>Assessing the readiness of data for analysis is one action that can
be taken, but assessing teams that need to assimilate the information in
the data is the other side of the coin. With this in mind both <a
href="https://medium.com/@damoncivin/the-joel-test-for-data-readiness-4882aae64753">Damon
Civin</a> and <a
href="https://blog.dominodatalab.com/joel-test-data-science/">Nick
Elprin</a> have independently proposed the idea of a “Data Joel Test”. A
“<a

Test</a>” is a short questionnaire to establish the ability of a team to
handle software engineering tasks. It is designed as a rough and ready
capability assessment. A “Data Joel Test” is similar, but for assessing
the capability of a team in performing data science.</p>

<p>Society is becoming harder to monitor, but the individual is becoming

<p>What does it mean for our free will if a computer can predict our
individual behavior better than we ourselves can?</p>
<p>There is potential for both explicit and implicit discrimination on
the basis of race, religion, sexuality or health status. All of these
are prohibited under European law but can pass unawares or be
implicit.</p>
<p>The GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, but a better name
for it would simply be Good Data Practice Rules. It covers how to deal
with discrimination which has a consequential effect on the individual.
For example, entrance to university, access to loans or insurance. But
the new phenomenon is dealing with a series of inconsequential decisions
that taken together have a consequential effect.</p>

<p>Statistics as a community is also focused on the single consequential
effect of an analysis (efficacy of drugs, or distribution of Mosquito
nets). Associated with happenstance data is <em>happenstance decision
making</em>.</p>
<p>These algorithms behind these decisions are developed in a particular
context. The so-called Silicon Valley bubble. But they are deployed
across the world. To address this, a key challenge is capacity building
in contexts which are remote from the Western norm.</p>
<h2 id="amelioration">Amelioration</h2>

<p>Addressing challenges in privacy, loss of control and marginalization
includes ensuring that the individual retains control of their own data.
We accept privacy in our real loves, we need to accept it in our digital
persona. This is vital for our control of persona and our ability to
project ourselves.</p>
<p>Fairness goes hand in hand with privacy to protect the individual.
Regulations like the GDPR date from a time where the main worry was
<em>consequential</em> decision making. Today we also face problems from
accumulation of inconsequential decisions leading to a resulting
consequential effect.</p>
<p>Capacity building in different contexts, empowering domain experts to
solve their own problems, is one aspect to the solution. A further
proposal is the use of data trusts to reintroduce control of personal
data for the individual.</p>
<h2 id="personal-data-trusts">Personal Data Trusts</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">
<span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated
decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data
there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but
also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for
targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to
identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual
selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The feudal system that is implied by current data protection
legislation has significant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the
data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data
subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too
late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often
their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but
that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy">Personal
Data Trusts</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Edwards:privacy04 Lawrence:trusts16 Delacroix:trusts18">(Delacroix
and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a
potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em>
that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to
the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organization
where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees’
responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the
motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the
data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under
which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would
be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of
individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the
Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded
with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily
involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems
clear that we need to better characterize the data sharing landscape as
well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data
sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it
feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be
taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider
negotiations.</p>

<p>Data Science Africa is a bottom up initiative for capacity building
in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence on the
African continent.</p>
<p>As of October 2021 there have been five workshops and five schools,
located in Nyeri, Kenya (twice); Kampala, Uganda; Arusha, Tanzania;
Abuja, Nigeria; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Kampala, Uganda and
Kimberley, South Africa.</p>
<p>The main notion is <em>end-to-end</em> data science. For example,
going from data collection in the farmer’s field to decision making in
the Ministry of Agriculture. Or going from malaria disease counts in
health centers to medicine distribution.</p>
<p>The philosophy is laid out in <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lawrence:dsa15">(Lawrence, 2015)</span>. The key idea is
that the modern <em>information infrastructure</em> presents new
solutions to old problems. Modes of development change because less
capital investment is required to take advantage of this infrastructure.
The philosophy is that local capacity building is the right way to
leverage these challenges in addressing data science problems in the
African context.</p>
<p>Data Science Africa is now a non-govermental organization registered
in Kenya. The organising board of the meeting is entirely made up of
scientists and academics based on the African continent.</p>

incidence in Uganda. For the purposes of this study malaria reports come
in two forms, HMIS reports from health centres and Sentinel data, which
is curated by the WHO. There are limited sentinel sites and many HMIS
sites.</p>
<p>The work is from Ricardo Andrade Pacheco’s PhD thesis, completed in
collaboration with John Quinn and Martin Mubangizi <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Andrade:consistent14 Mubangizi:malaria14">(Andrade-Pacheco
et al., 2014; Mubangizi et al., 2014)</span>. John and Martin were
initally from the AI-DEV group from the University of Makerere in
Kampala and more latterly they were based at UN Global Pulse in Kampala.

<p>Malaria data is spatial data. Uganda is split into districts, and
health reports can be found for each district. This suggests that models
such as conditional random fields could be used for spatial modelling,
but there are two complexities with this. First of all, occasionally
districts split into two. Secondly, sentinel sites are a specific
location within a district, such as Nagongera which is a sentinel site
based in the Tororo district.</p>

<p>Health monitoring system for the Kabarole district. Here we have
fitted the reports with a Gaussian process with an additive covariance
function. It has two components, one is a long time scale component (in
red above) the other is a short time scale component (in blue).</p>
<p>Monitoring proceeds by considering two aspects of the curve. Is the
blue line (the short term report signal) above the red (which represents
the long term trend? If so we have higher than expected reports. If this
is the case <em>and</em> the gradient is still positive (i.e. reports
are going up) we encode this with a <em>red</em> color. If it is the
case and the gradient of the blue line is negative (i.e. reports are
going down) we encode this with an <em>amber</em> color. Conversely, if
the blue line is below the red <em>and</em> decreasing, we color
<em>green</em>. On the other hand if it is below red but increasing, we
color <em>yellow</em>.</p>
<p>This gives us an early warning system for disease. Red is a bad
situation getting worse, amber is bad, but improving. Green is good and
getting better and yellow good but degrading.</p>

the effect is small.</p>

<p>Figure: Packhorse Bridge under Burbage Edge. This packhorse route
climbs steeply out of Hathersage and heads towards Sheffield. Packhorses
were the main route for transporting goods across the Peak District. The
high cost of transport is one driver of the ‘smith’ model, where there
is a local skilled person responsible for assembling or creating goods
(e.g. a blacksmith).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On Sunday mornings in Sheffield, I often used to run across Packhorse
Bridge in Burbage valley. The bridge is part of an ancient network of
trails crossing the Pennines that, before Turnpike roads arrived in the
18th century, was the main way in which goods were moved. Given that the
moors around Sheffield were home to sand quarries, tin mines, lead mines
and the villages in the Derwent valley were known for nail and pin
manufacture, this wasn’t simply movement of agricultural goods, but it
was the infrastructure for industrial transport.</p>
<p>The profession of leading the horses was known as a Jagger and
leading out of the village of Hathersage is Jagger’s Lane, a trail that
headed underneath Stanage Edge and into Sheffield.</p>
<p>The movement of goods from regions of supply to areas of demand is
fundamental to our society. The physical infrastructure of supply chain
has evolved a great deal over the last 300 years.</p>

<p>Figure: Richard Arkwright is regarded of the founder of the modern
factory system. Factories exploit distribution networks to centralize
production of goods. Arkwright located his factory in Cromford due to
proximity to Nottingham Weavers (his market) and availability of water
power from the tributaries of the Derwent river. When he first arrived
there was almost no transportation network. Over the following 200 years
The Cromford Canal (1790s), a Turnpike (now the A6, 1816-18) and the
High Peak Railway (now closed, 1820s) were all constructed to improve
transportation access as the factory blossomed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Richard Arkwright is known as the father of the modern factory
system. In 1771 he set up a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Mill">Mill</a> for spinning
cotton yarn in the village of Cromford, in the Derwent Valley. The
Derwent valley is relatively inaccessible. Raw cotton arrived in
Liverpool from the US and India. It needed to be transported on
packhorse across the bridleways of the Pennines. But Cromford was a good
location due to proximity to Nottingham, where weavers where consuming
the finished thread, and the availability of water power from small
tributaries of the Derwent river for Arkwright’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny">water frames</a>
which automated the production of yarn from raw cotton.</p>
<p>By 1794 the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Canal">Cromford Canal</a>
was opened to bring coal in to Cromford and give better transport to
Nottingham. The construction of the canals was driven by the need to
improve the transport infrastructure, facilitating the movement of goods
across the UK. Canals, roads and railways were initially constructed by
the economic need for moving goods. To improve supply chain.</p>
<p>The A6 now does pass through Cromford, but at the time he moved there
there was merely a track. The High Peak Railway was opened in 1832, it
is now converted to the High Peak Trail, but it remains the highest
railway built in Britain.</p>

<p>This effect on cost of transport vs cost of processing is the main
driver of the topology of the modern supply chain and the associated
effect of globalization. If transport is much cheaper than processing,
then processing will tend to agglomerate in places where processing
costs can be minimized.</p>
<p>Large scale global economic change has principally been driven by
changes in the technology that drives supply chain.</p>
<p>Supply chain is a large-scale automated decision making network. Our
aim is to make decisions not only based on our models of customer
behavior (as observed through data), but also by accounting for the
structure of our fulfilment center, and delivery network.</p>
<p>Many of the most important questions in supply chain take the form of
counterfactuals. E.g. “What would happen if we opened a manufacturing
facility in Cambridge?” A counter factual is a question that implies a
mechanistic understanding of a system. It goes beyond simple smoothness
assumptions or translation invariants. It requires a physical, or
<em>mechanistic</em> understanding of the supply chain network. For this
reason, the type of models we deploy in supply chain often involve
simulations or more mechanistic understanding of the network.</p>
<p>In supply chain Machine Learning alone is not enough, we need to
bridge between models that contain real mechanisms and models that are
entirely data driven.</p>
<p>This is challenging, because as we introduce more mechanism to the
models we use, it becomes harder to develop efficient algorithms to
match those models to data.</p>

<p>One project where the components of machine learning and the physical
world come together is Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery system.</p>
<p>Automating the process of moving physical goods through autonomous
vehicles completes the loop between the ‘bits’ and the ‘atoms’. In other
words, the information and the ‘stuff’. The idea of the drone is to
complete a component of package delivery, the notion of last mile
movement of goods, but in a fully autonomous way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we announced earlier this year that we were evolving our Prime
two-day shipping offer in the U.S. to a one-day program, the response
was terrific. But we know customers are always looking for something
better, more convenient, and there may be times when one-day delivery
may not be the right choice. Can we deliver packages to customers even
faster? We think the answer is yes, and one way we’re pursuing that goal
is by pioneering autonomous drone technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Today at Amazon’s re:MARS Conference (Machine Learning, Automation,
Robotics and Space) in Las Vegas, we unveiled our latest Prime Air drone
design. We’ve been hard at work building fully electric drones that can
fly up to 15 miles and deliver packages under five pounds to customers
in less than 30 minutes. And, with the help of our world-class
fulfillment and delivery network, we expect to scale Prime Air both
quickly and efficiently, delivering packages via drone to customers
within months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 15 miles in less than 30 minutes implies air speed velocities of
around 50 kilometers per hour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our newest drone design includes advances in efficiency, stability
and, most importantly, in safety. It is also unique, and it advances the
state of the art. How so? First, it’s a hybrid design. It can do
vertical takeoffs and landings – like a helicopter. And it’s efficient
and aerodynamic—like an airplane. It also easily transitions between
these two modes—from vertical-mode to airplane mode, and back to
vertical mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s fully shrouded for safety. The shrouds are also the wings, which
makes it efficient in flight.</p>

<p>Our drones need to be able to identify static and moving objects
coming from any direction. We employ diverse sensors and advanced
algorithms, such as multi-view stereo vision, to detect static objects
like a chimney. To detect moving objects, like a paraglider or
helicopter, we use proprietary computer-vision and machine learning
algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A customer’s yard may have clotheslines, telephone wires, or
electrical wires. Wire detection is one of the hardest challenges for
low-altitude flights. Through the use of computer-vision techniques
we’ve invented, our drones can recognize and avoid wires as they descend
into, and ascend out of, a customer’s yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We separated the challenges we face into three groups: (1) paradoxes
of the odern data society, (2) quantifying the value of data and (3)
privacy loss of control and marginalization. We’ve noted the origins of
the paradoxes, speculating that it is based in a form of data (or
modelling) inattention bias demonstrated through the Gorilla. We’ve
drawn parallels between challenges of rewarding the addition of value
and the credit assignment problem in reinforecement learning and we’ve
looked at approaches to introduce the voice of marginalized societies
and people into the conversation.</p>
