title: Hierarchical Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models
abstract: The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) is a powerful approach
  for probabilistic modelling of high dimensional data through dimensional reduction.
  In this paper we extend the GP-LVM through hierarchies. A hierarchical model (such
  as a tree) allows us to express conditional independencies in the data as well as
  the manifold structure. We first introduce Gaussian process hierarchies through
  a simple dynamical model, we then extend the approach to a more complex hierarchy
  which is applied to the visualisation of human motion data sets.
