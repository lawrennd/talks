  This lecture will provide the background in probability theory that
  we will make use of during the coming weeks. For many of you this
  will be things that you have seen before but we will try to provide
  a slightly different semantic to the purely mathematical concepts
  that we will use throughout the course.

This lecture aims to do a quick introduction to the main building blocks of machine learning and make steps towards making the concepts introduced in the first lecture more mathematically grounded. In addition to the lecture notes there is also a worksheet that provides a more step-by-step walkthrough of the material. You can download the lecture slides [here]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/slides/l49-mlpw-02.pdf) and the worksheet [here]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/01_introduction.pdf).
