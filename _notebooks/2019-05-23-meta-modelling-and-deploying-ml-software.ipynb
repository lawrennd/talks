    "as a particular stage in machining (by analogy to productionlines in\n",
    "factories) or a sub-routine call in computing. Machine learning allows\n",
    "any complex sub-task, that was difficult to decompose by classical\n",
    "methods, to be reconstituted by acquiring data. In particular, when we\n",
    "think of emulating a human, we can ask many humans to perform the\n",
    "sub-task many times and fit machine learning models to reconstruct the\n",
    "performance, or to *emulate* the human in the performance of the task.\n",
    "For example, the decomposition of a complex process such as driving a\n",
    "car into apparently obvious sub-tasks (following the road, identifying\n",
    "pedestrians, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The practitioner's approach to deploying artificial intelligence systems\n",
    "is to build up systems of machine learning components. To build a\n",
    "machine learning system, we decompose the task into parts, each of which\n",
    "we can emulate with ML methods. These parts are typically independently\n",
    "constructed and verified. For example, in a driverless car we can\n",
    "decompose the tasks into components such as \"pedestrian detection\" and\n",
    "\"road line detection\". Each of these components can be constructed with,\n",
    "for example, a classification algorithm. Nowadays, people will often\n",
    "deploy a deep neural network, but for many tasks a random forest\n",
    "algorithm may be sufficient. We can then superimpose a logic on top. For\n",
    "example, \"Follow the road line unless you detect a pedestrian in the\n",
    "road\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for verification of car performance, as long as we can\n",
    "verify the individual components. However, it also implies that the AI\n",
    "systems we deploy are *fragile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intelligent systems are composed by \"pigeonholing\" each indvidual\n",
    "task, then substituting with a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not a robust approach to systems design. The definition of\n",
    "sub-tasks can lead to a single point of failure, where if any sub-task\n",
    "fails, the entire system fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rapid Reimplementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the classical approach to automation, but in traditional\n",

    "stick are likely to be minimal. But more thought would be put into\n",
    "those lines than perhaps any other lines of code in the system.\n",
    "\n",
