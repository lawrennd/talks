title: "Data Science: Is it Time for Professionalisation?"
abstract: >
  Machine learning methods and software are becoming widely
  deployed. But how are we sharing expertise about bottlenecks and
  pain points in deploying solutions? In terms of the practice of data
  science, we seem to be at a similar point today as software
  engineering was in the early 1980s. Best practice is not widely
  understood or deployed. In this talk we will focus on two particular
  components of data science solutions: the preparation of data snd
  the deployment of machine learning systems.

### Machine Learning

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$

* Royal Society Report:
  [Machine Learning: Power and Promise of Computers that Learn by Example](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf)

### Machine Learning as the Driver ... {.slide: data-transition="none"}


... of two different domains

1. *Data Science*: arises from the fact that we now capture data by happenstance.

2. *Artificial Intelligence*: emulation of human behaviour.


### What does Machine Learning do?

* ML Automates through Data

    * *Strongly* related to statistics.

    * Field underpins revolution in *data science* and *AI*

* With AI: logic, robotics, computer vision, speech

* With Data Science: databases, data mining, statistics, visualization

### What does Machine Learning do?

* We scale by codifying processes and automating them.

    * Ensure components are compatible (Whitworth threads)

    * Then interconnect them as efficiently as possible.

    * cf Colt 45, Ford Model T


### Codify Through Mathematical Functions 

* How does machine learning work?

* Jumper (jersey/sweater) purchase with logistic regression

$$ \text{odds} = \frac{\text{bought}}{\text{not bought}} $$

$$ \log \text{odds}  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{latitude}$$


### Codify Through Mathematical Functions {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* How does machine learning work?

* Jumper (jersey/sweater) purchase with logistic regression

$$ p(\text{bought}) =  f\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{lattitude}\right)$$


### Codify Through Mathematical Functions {.slide: data-transition="none"}

* How does machine learning work?

* Jumper (jersey/sweater) purchase with logistic regression

$$ p(\text{bought}) =  f\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x}\right)$$


### Deep Learning

* These are interpretable models: vital for disease etc.

* Modern machine learning methods are less interpretable

* Example: face recognition

### Data Science

* Industrial Revolution 4.0?

* *Industrial Revolution* (1760-1840) term coined by Arnold Toynbee,
late 19th century.

* Maybe: But this one is dominated by *data* not *capital*

* That presents *challenges* and *opportunities* 

cf
[digital oligarchy](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/05/digital-oligarchy-algorithms-personal-data)
vs [how Africa can benefit from the data revolution](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/aug/25/africa-benefit-data-science-information)

* Apple vs Nokia: How you handle disruption.


### A Time for Professionalisation?

* New technologies historically led to new professions:

    * Brunel (born 1806): Civil, mechanical, naval

    * Tesla (born 1856): Electrical and power
 
    * William Shockley (born 1910): Electronic 

    * Watts S. Humphrey (born 1927): Software

### Why?

* Codification of best practice.

* Developing trust

### Where are we?

* Perhaps around the 1980s of programming.

    * We understand if, for, procedures

    * But we don't share best practice.

* Let's *avoid* the over formalisation of software engineering.

### The Software Crisis

>The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have
>become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite
>bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem
>at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild
>problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an
>equally gigantic problem.
>
> Edsger Dijkstra, The Humble Programmer

### The Data Crisis

>The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more
>interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but
>data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high quality
>data. That implies that we develop processes for improving and
>verifying data quality that are efficient.

>There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we
>should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possibly we should automate
>work.

### Rest of this Talk: Two Areas of Focus

* Reusability of Data

* Deployment of Machine Learning Systems

### Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

<img src="./diagrams/sea-water-ocean-waves.jpg" width="50%">

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


### Data Quotes

* 90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)
* "The Dirty Work We Don't Want to Think About" (Eric Xing)
* "Voodoo to get it decompressed" (Francisco Giminez)
* Getting money from management for data collection and annotation can
be a total nightmare.

### Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?

* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management

	* Incentivization for sharing and production.

	* Quantifying the value in the contribution of *each actor*.


### Data Readiness Levels

   [Data Readiness Levels](http://inverseprobability.com/2017/01/12/data-readiness-levels)
   (see also [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02245.pdf))

* Three Grades of Data Readiness:

* Grade C - accessibility

* Grade B - validity

* Grade A - usability


### Accessibility: Grade C

* Hearsay data.
* Availability, is it actually being recorded?
* privacy or legal constraints on the accessibility of the recorded data, have ethical constraints been alleviated?
* Format: log books, PDF ...
* limitations on access due to topology (e.g. it's distributed across a number of devices)
* At the end of Grade C data is ready to be loaded into analysis software (R, SPSS, Matlab, Python, Mathematica)

### Validity: Grade B

* faithfulness and representation
* visualisations.
* exploratory data analysis
* noise characterisation.
* Missing values.
* Schema alignment, record linkage, data fusion? 
* Example, was a column or columns accidentally perturbed (e.g. through a sort operation that missed one or more columns)? Or was a [gene name accidentally converted to a date](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)?
* At the end of Grade B, ready to define a candidate question, the
  context, load into OpenML

### Usability: Grade A

* The usability of data
* Grade A is about data in context.
* Consider appropriateness of a given data set to answer a particular
question or to be subject to a particular analysis.
* Data integration?
* At the end of Grade A it's ready for data platforms such as RAMP, Kaggle, define a *task* in OpenML.

### Recursive Effects

* Grade A may also require:

    * active collection of new data.

    * rebalancing of data to ensure fairness

	* annotation of data by human experts 

	* revisiting the collection (and running through the appropriate stages again)

### Contribute!

* <http://data-readiness.org>


### Also ...

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage *visualization* of data

* Incentivise the delivery of data.

### Artificial Intelligence

* Suggested a split between artificial intelligence.

* Next section explore the challenges of deploying AI.

* Currently this is in the form of "machine learning systems"


### Internet of People

* Fog computing: barrier between cloud and device blurring.

* Stuxnet: Adversarial and Security implications for intelligent systems.

* Complex feedback between algorithm and implementation
  
### Deploying ML in Real World: Machine Learning Systems Design

* Major new challenge for systems designers.

* Internet of Intelligence but currently:

	* AI systems are currently *fragile*

### Fragility of AI Systems

* They are componentwise built from ML Capabilities.

* Each capability is independently constructed and verified.

   * Pedestrian detection
   * Road line detection

* Important for verification purposes.

### Rapid Reimplementation

* Whole systems are being deployed.

* But they change their environment.

* The experience evolved adversarial behaviour.

### Machine Learning Systems Design

<img src="./diagrams/SteamEngine_Boulton&Watt_1784_neg.png" width="50%" style="border:none">

### Turnaround And Update

* There is a massive need for turn around and update

* A redeploy of the entire system.
     *  This involves changing the way we design and deploy.

* Interface between security engineering and machine learning.

### Peppercorns

* A new name for system failures which aren't bugs.

* Difference between finding a fly in your soup vs a peppercorn in
  your soup.

### Conclusion

* Difference between Artificial Intelligence and Data Science are fundamentally different.

* In one you are dealing with data collected by happenstance.

* In the other you are trying to build systems in the real world, often by actively collecting data.

* Our approaches to systems design are building powerful machines that
will be deployed in evolving environments.
