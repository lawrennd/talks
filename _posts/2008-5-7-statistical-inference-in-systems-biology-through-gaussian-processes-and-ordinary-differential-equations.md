  In this talk we will summarise recent work from our group in Manchester
  on inferring ‘latent biochemical species’ in biological systems using
  Gaussian processes and differential equations. A key problem in
  biological data is when particular biochemical species of interest are
  not directly measurable. We will show how the framework of Gaussian
  processes can be brought to bear on the problem and values of latent
  chemical species can be inferred given data and a differential equation
  model.
