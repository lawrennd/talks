title: Machine Learning with Gaussian Processes
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled probabilistic approach to
  prior probability distributions for functions. In this talk we will give an overview
  of some uses of GPs and their extensions. In particular we will introduce mechanistic
  models alongside GPs and also use GPs within a structured framework of latent variable
  models.
