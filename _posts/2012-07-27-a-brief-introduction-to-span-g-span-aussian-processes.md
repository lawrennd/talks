title: A Brief Introduction to <span>G</span>aussian Processes
abstract: Gaussian processes are non-parametric probabilistic models for function
  representation. In this tutorial we give a brief introduction to Gaussian process
  models. Using simple examples we show how, with particular choices for covariance
  functions (analagous to a kernel matrix in kernel methods), we can perform inference
  about functions using only data sampled from those functions. We give overview how
  the probabilistic interpretation allows us to fit the parameters of the covariance
  function.
