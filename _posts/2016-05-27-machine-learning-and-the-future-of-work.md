title: Machine Learning and the Future of Work
abstract: Machine learning technologies have evolved to the extent that they are now
  considered the principle underlying technology for our advances in artificial intelligence.
  Artificial intelligence is an emotive term, given the implications for replacing
  qualities that humans consider specific to ourselves. As always new technology has
  a significant disruptive effect on existing markets, jobs and economies. In this
  talk weâ€™ll explore where the advances are coming from and speculate about how our
  machine learning future is likely to pan out with a particular focus on work.
