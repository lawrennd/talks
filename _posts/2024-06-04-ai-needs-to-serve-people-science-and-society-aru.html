title: "AI needs to serve people, science, and society"
venue: "Digitalisation and AI for public value"
abstract: "Artificial intelligence offers great promise, but we must
ensure it does not deepen inequalities. In this provocation we will
argue that AI hasn’t delivered on what society has asked of it, but it
new technologies mean it could do."

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is
not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across
society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own

bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<p>Popper opened the preface to his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="Popper-open45">(Popper, 1945)</span> with the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to
belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to
great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to
show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial
attack on freedom and reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had written the book against the background of the second world
war, his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria
in March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For Popper, the ideas of “great men” become totalitarian when imposed
on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form
of government that can allow for institutional change without bloodshed.
The open society is one characterized by institutions and individuals
that can engage in the practical pursuit of solutions to social and
political problems. The institutions are also underpinned by
individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil administrators and many more.
To Popper it is these “piecemeal social engineers” who offer pragmatic
solutions to our society’s political and social challenges.</p>
