  In this tutorial we will review spectral approaches to dimensionality
  reduction, introducing a unifying probabilistic perspective. Our
  unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle and the
  resulting probabilistic models are based on GRFs. We will review maximum
  variance unfolding, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embeddings and
  Isomap. Under the framework, these approaches can be divided into those
  that preserve local distances and those that donâ€™t. For two small data
  sets we show that local distance preserving methods tend to perform
  better. Finally we use the unifying framework to relate these approaches
  to the Gaussian process latent variable model.
