  Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an
  accurate mechanistic model of data, often based on differential
  equations. Statistical and machine learning approaches are typically
  data driven-perhaps through regularized function approximation.\
  {These two approaches to data modeling are often seen as polar
  opposites, but in reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of
  approaches we might take. Physics based approaches can be seen as
  strongly mechanistic, the mechanistic assumptions are hard encoded into
  the model. Data-driven approaches do incorporate assumptions that might
  be seen as being derived from some underlying mechanism, such as
  smoothness. In this sense they are weakly mechanistic.\
  {In this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force models are
  a new approach to data representation that model data through unknown
  forcing functions that drive differential equation models. By treating
  the unknown forcing functions with Gaussian process priors we can create
  probabilistic models that exhibit particular physical characteristics of
  interest, for example, in dynamical systems resonance and inertia. This
  allows us to perform a synthesis of the data driven and physical
  modeling paradigms. A moderately mechanistic approach. We show an
  application in modelling of human motion capture data.
