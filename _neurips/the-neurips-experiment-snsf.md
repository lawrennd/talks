\notes{I would prefer a world were a conference is no longer viewed as a proxy for research quality. The true test of quality is time. In the current world, papers from conferences such as NeurIPS are being used to judge whether a researcher is worthy of a position at a leading company, or whether a researcher gets tenure. This is problematic and damaging for the community. Reviewing is an inconsistent process, but that is not a bad thing. It is far worse to have a reviewing system that is consistently wrong than one which is inconsistently wrong.}

\notes{My own view of a NeurIPS paper is inspired by the Millenium Galleries in Sheffield. There, among the exhibitions they sometimes have work done by apprentices in their 'qualification'. Sheffield is known for knives, and the work of the apprentices in making knives is sometimes very intricate indeed. But it does lead to some very impractical knives. NeurIPS seems to be good at judging technical skill, but not impact. And I suspect the same is true of many other meetings. So, a publication a NeurIPS does seem to indicate that the author has some of the skills required, but it does not necessarily imply that the paper will be impactful.}
