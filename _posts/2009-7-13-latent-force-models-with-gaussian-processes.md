  We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent
  variable. Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn
  from a distribution, e.g. probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This
  simplification is often extended for temporal data where tractable
  Markovian independence assumptions are used (e.g. Kalman filters or
  hidden Markov models). In this talk we will consider the more general
  case where the latent variable is a forcing function in a differential
  equation model. We will firstly give a brief introduction to Gaussian
  processes, then we will show how for some simple ordinary differential
  equations the latent variable can be dealt with analytically for
  particular Gaussian process priors over the latent force. In this talk
  we will introduce the general framework, present results in systems
  biology and motion capture.
