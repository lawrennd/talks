abstract: In the second part of this tutorial we will develop non linear approaches
  to dimensionality reduction from the probabilistic perspective. Firstly we will
  briefly review a probabilistic perspectives on spectral approaches, and then we
  will build on the non-linear approaches we derived using Gaussian processes in the
  first part of the tutorial. We will show extensions which include the stacking of
  Gaussian process models to give deep Gaussian processes, a probabilistic model for
  unsupervised learning.
