abstract: We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent variable.
  Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn from a distribution,
  e.g. probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This simplification is often extended
  for temporal data where tractable Markovian independence assumptions are used (e.g.
  Kalman filters or hidden Markov models). In this talk we will consider the more
  general case where the latent variable is a forcing function in a differential equation
  model. We will firstly give a brief introduction to Gaussian processes, then we
  will show how for some simple ordinary differential equations the latent variable
  can be dealt with analytically for particular Gaussian process priors over the latent
  force. In this talk we will introduce the general framework, present results in
  systems biology and motion capture.
