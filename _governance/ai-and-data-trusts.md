title: "AI and Data Trusts"
abstract: >
  Resolutely complementary to top-down regulation, bottom-up data
  trusts aim to 'give a voice' to data subjects whose choices when it
  comes to data governance are often reduced to binary, ill-informed
  consent. While the rights granted by instruments like the GDPR can
  be used as tools in a bit to shape possible data-reliant futures -
  such as better use of natural resources, medical care etc., their
  exercise is both demanding and unlikely to be as impactful when
  leveraged individually. The power that stems from aggregated data
  should be returned to individuals through the legal mechanism of
  trusts.
