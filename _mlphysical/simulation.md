\notes{Last lecture Carl Henrik introduced you to some of the challenges of approximate inference. Including the problem of mathematical tractability. Before that he introduced you to a particular form of model, the Gaussian process.}

\include{_gp/includes/gp-intro-very-short.md}

\notes{So, Gaussian processes provide an example of a particular type of model. Or, scientifically, we can think of such a model as a mathematical representation of a hypothesis around data. The rejection sampling view of Bayesian inference can be seen as rejecting portions of that initial hypothesis that are inconsistent with the data. From a Popperian perspective, areas of the prior space are falsified by the data, leaving a posterior space that represents remaining plausible hypotheses.}

\notes{The flaw with this point of view is that the initial hypothesis space was also restricted. It only contained functions where the instantiated points from the function are jointly Gaussian distributed.}

\notes{Those Cosmological simulations are based on a relatively simple set of 'rules' that stem from our understanding of natural laws. These 'rules' are mathematical abstractions of the physical world. Representations of behaviour in mathematical form that capture the interaction forces between particles. The grand aim of physics has been to unify these rules into a single unifying theory. Popular understanding of this quest developed as a result of Stephen Hawking's book, "[A Brief History of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time)". The idea of these laws as 'ultimate causes' has given them a pseudo religious feel, see for example Paul Davies's book "[The Mind of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_God)" which comes from a quotation form Stephen Hawking. }

\speakernotes{Nice quote but having a unifying theory doesn't give us omniscience.}

\notes{This is an entrancing quote, that seems to work well for selling books (A Brief History of Time sold over 10 million copies), but as Laplace has already pointed out to us, the Universe doesn't work quite so simply as that. Commonly, God is thought to be omniscient, but having a grand unifying theory alone doesn't give us omniscience.}

\notes{Laplace's demon still applies. Even if we had a grand unifying theory, which encoded "all the forces that set nature in motion" we have an amount of work left to do in any quest for 'omniscience'.}

\speakernotes{I like to refer to this notion as "Laplace's Gremlin", because the lack of knowledge is the "gremlin of uncertainty" that inhibits the "deterministic demon"}

\notes{The representation of ignorance through probability is the true message of Laplace, I refer to this message as "Laplace's gremlin", because it is the gremlin of uncertainty that interferes with the demon of determinism to mean that our predictions are not deterministic. 

Our separation of the uncertainty into the data, the model and the computation gives us three domains in which our doubts can creep into our ability to predict. Over the last three lectures we've introduced some of the basic tools we can use to unpick this uncertainty. In particular, you've been introduced to, (or have yow reviewed) *Bayes' rule*. The rule, which is a simple consequence of the product rule of probability, is the foundation of how we update our beliefs in the presence of new information.}

\newslide{}

\notes{Carl Henrik described how a prior probability $p(\parameterVector)$ represents our hypothesis about the way the world might behave. This can be combined with a *likelihood* through the process of multiplication. Correctly normalized, this gives an updated hypothesis that represents our *posterior* belief about the model in the light of the data.

There is a nice symmetry between this approach and how Karl Popper describes the process of scientific discovery. In conjectures and refutations, Popper describes the process of scientific discovery as involving hypothesis and experiment. In our description hypothesis maps onto the *model*. The model is an abstraction of the hypothesis, represented for example as a set of mathematical equations, a computational description or an analogous system (physical system). The data is the product of previous experiments, our readings, our observation of the world around us. We can combine these to make a prediction about what we might expect the future to hold. Popper's view on the philosophy of science was that the prediction should be falsifiable. 

We can see this process as a spiral driving forward, importantly Popper relates the relationship between hypothesis (model) and experiment (predictions) as akin to the relationship between the chicken and the egg. Which comes first? The answer is that they co-evolve together.}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/ml/experiment-analyze-design}{50%}}{Experiment, analyze and design is a flywheel of knowledge that is the dual of the model, data and compute. By running through this spiral, we refine our hypothesis/model and develop new experiments which can be analyzed to further refine our hypothesis.}{experiment-analyze-design}


\newslide{}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/physics/different-models}{90%}}{The sets of different models. There are all the models in the Universe we might like to work with. Then there are those models that are computable e.g. by a Turing machine. Then there are those which are analytical tractable. I.e. where the solution might be found analytically. Finally, there are Gaussian processes, where the joint distribution of the states in the model is Gaussian.}


\notes{The approach we've taken to the model so far has been severely limiting. By constraining ourselves to models for which the mathematics of probability is tractable, we severely limit what we can say about the universe.

Although Bayes' rule only implies multiplication of probabilities, to acquire theposterior we also need to normalize. Very often it is this normalization step that gets in the way. The normalization step involves integration over the updated hypothesis space, to ensure the updated posterior prediction is correct.

We can map the process of Bayesian inference onto the the $\text{model} + \text{data}$ perspective in the following way. We can see the model as the prior, the data as the likelihood and the prediction as the posterior[^mapping]. 

[^mapping]: We should be careful about such mappings, this is the one I prefer to think about because I try to think of my modelling assumptions as being stored in a probabilistic model, which I see as the prior distribution over what I expect the data to look like. In many domains of parametric modelling, however, the prior will be specified over the parameters of a model. In the Gaussian process formalism we're using, this mapping is clearer though. The 'prior' is the Gaussian process prior over functions, the data is the relationship between those functions and observations we make. This mental model will also suit what follows in terms of our consideration of simulation. But it would likely confuse someone who had only come to Bayesian inference through parametric models such a neural networks. Note that even in such models, there will be a way of writing down the decomposition of the model that is akin to the above, but it might involve writing down intractable densities so it's often avoided.}

\newslide{}


\notes{So, if we think of our model as incorporating what we know about the physical problem of interest (from Newton, or Bernoulli or Laplace or Einstein or whoever) and the data as being the observations (e.g. from Piazzi's telescope or a particle accelerator) then we can make predictions about what we might expect to happen in the future by combining the two. It is *those* predictions that Popper sees as important in verifying the scientific theory (which is incorporated in the model).

But while Gaussian processes are highly flexible non-parametric function models, they are *not* going to be sufficient to capture the type of physical processes we might expect to encounter in the real world. To give a sense, let's consider a few examples of the phenomena we might want to capture, either in the scientific world, or in real world decision making.}

\section{Precise Physical Laws}

\slides{* Newton's laws
* Huygens and conservation of energy
* Daniel Bernoulli and the kinetic theory of gases
* Modern climate simulation and Navier-Stokes equations
}

\speakernotes{Precise physical laws are predictive of the future. Met office super computer uses 1 km grids cells to compute the weather.}

\notes{We've already reviewed the importance of Newton's laws in forging our view of science: we mentioned the influence [Christiaan Huygens'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) work on collisions had on Daniel Bernoulli in forming the kinetic theory of gases. These ideas inform many of the physical models we have today around a number of natural phenomena. The MET Office super computer in Exeter spends its mornings computing the weather across the world, and in its afternoons it's used for climate modelling. It uses the same set of principles that Newton and Bernoulli explored for gases. They are encoded in the Navier-Stokes equations. The rules that govern the flow of compressible and incompressible fluids. As well as predicting our weather, these equations are used in fluid dynamics models to understand the flight of aircraft, the driving characteristics of racing cars and the efficiency of gas turbine engines.

This broad class of physical models, or 'natural laws' is probably the closest to what Laplace was referring to in the Demon. The search for unifying physical laws that dictate everything we observe around us has gone on. Alongside Newton we must mention James Clerk Maxwell, who unified electricity and magnetism in one set of equations that were inspired by the work and ideas of Michael Faraday. And still today we look for unifying equations that bring together in a single mathematical model the 'natural laws' we observe. One equation that for Laplace would be "all forces that set nature in motion". We can think of this as our first time of physical model, a 'precise model' of the known laws of our Universe, a model where we expect that the mapping from the mathematical abstraction to the physical reality is 'exact'.[^exact]

[^exact]: Unfortunately, I have to use the term 'exact' loosely here! For example, most of these laws treat space/time as a continuum. But in reality, it is quantised. The smallest length we can define is Planck length ($1.61 \times 10^{-35}$), and the the smallest time is Planck time. So even in this exact world of Maxwell and Newton there is an abstraction or a discretisation.}

\subsection{Abstraction and Emergent Properties}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/physics/simulation-scales}{90%}}{A scale of different simulations we might be interested in when modelling the physical world. The scale is $\log_10$ meters. The scale reflects something about the level of granularity where we might choose to know "all positions of all items of which nature is composed".}{simulation-scales} 

\newslide{Abstraction}

\slides{* We often abstract smaller scales away e.g. in statistical mechanics.
* When we're abstracting finer length scales we can introduce uncertainties.
    * E.g. Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for ideal Gas.}


\notes{Unfortunately, even if such an equation were to exist, we would be unlikely to know "all positions of all items of which nature is composed". A good example here is computational systems biology. In that domain we are interested in understanding the undelying function of the cell. These systems sit somewhere between the two extremes that Laplace described: "the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the smallest atom".}

\notes{When the smallest atom is considered, we need to introduce uncertainty. We again turn to a different work of Maxwell, building on Bernoulli's kinetic theory of gases we end up with probabilities for representing the location of the 'molecules of air'. Instead of a deterministic location for these particles we represent our belief about their location in a distribution.}

\newslide{Emergence}

\slides{* But fine scale local-laws also lead to emergent properties.
* Some of these properties exist at large scale.
* In particular, when there are complex interactions between molecules.}

\speakernotes{Ideal gas is a model where interaction between molecules is relatively simple. If this interaction is more complex (e.g. through quantum interactions of their bonded electrons, more structure exists.}

\notes{Computational systems biology is a world of micro-machines, built of three dimensional foldings of strings of proteins. There are spindles (stators) and rotors (e.g. [ATP Synthase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase)), there are small copying machines (e.g. [RNA Polymerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase)) there are sequence to sequence translators ([Ribosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome)). The cells store information in DNA, but have an ecosystem of structures and messages being sent and built in proteins and RNA. Unpikcing these structures has been a major preoccupation of biology. That is knowing where the atoms of these molecules are in the structure, and how the parts of the structure move when these small micro-machines are carrying out their roles.} 

\notes{We understand most (if not all) of the physical laws that drive the movements of these molecules, but we don't understand all the actions of the cell, nor can we intervene reliably to improve things. So even in the case where we have a good understanding of the physical laws, Laplace's gremlin emerges in our knowledge of "the positions of all items of which nature is composed".}

\subsection{Molecular Dynamics Simulations}

\notes{By understanding and simulating the physics, we can recreate operations that are happening at the level of proteins in the human cell. [V-ATPase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-ATPase) is an enzyme that pumps protons.  But at the microscopic level it's a small machine. produces ATP in response to a proton gradient. A recent paper in Science Advanes simulates the functioning of these proteins that operate across from The response to this is to use a mathematical model which (somewhat) abstracts the processes. You can also check this [blog post](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2020-10-07-first-detailed-look-how-molecular-ferris-wheel-delivers-protons-cellular-factories) from the paper's press release.}

\figure{\includegif{\diagramsDir/sysbio/rotary_proton_sv_pump_anim_final}{40%}}{The V-ATPase enzyme pumps proteins across membranes. This molecular dynamics simulation was recently published in Science Advances [@Roh-cryo-em20]. The scale is roughly $10^{-8} m$.}{v-atp-ase}

\speakernotes{Those complex interactions can also be modelled, but we can no longer summarize with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We need molecular dynamics simulations which can be combined with imaging using electron microscopes operating at extremely cold temperatures.}

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}

\notes{Alternative we can drop down a few scales and consider simulation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. A recent paper uses deep neural networks to speed up the solution of the many-electron SchrÃ¶dinger equation enabling simulation of chemical bonds [@Pfau-abinitio20]. The [PR-blog post is also available](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/FermiNet) and is rather better written than the V-ATPase version. The paper uses a neural network to model the quantum state of a number of electrons.}

\figure{\includegif{\diagramsDir/physics/many-electron-schroedinger}{40%}}{The many-electron Schroedinger equation is important in understanding how Chemical bonds are formed.}{many-electron-schroedinger}

\notes{Each of these simulations have the same property of being based on a set of (physical) rules about how particles interact. But one of the interesting characteristics of such systems is how the properties of the system are emergent as the dynamics are allowed to continue. 

These properties cannot be predicted without running the physics, or the equivalently the equation. Computation is required. And often the amount of computation that is required is prohibitive.}

\subsection{Accelerate Programme}

\slides{* Computer Lab hosts Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery
* Use ML techniques to deliver scientific advances
* Four DECAF fellows: MPhil Projects Available!}

\notes{The Computer Lab is hosting a new initiative, funded by Schmidt Futures, known as the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-programme-to-accelerate-ai-research-capability-at-cambridge). The aim is to address scientific challenges, and accelerate the progress of research, through using tools in machine learning.}

\notes{We now have four fellows appointed, each of whom works at the interface of machine learning and scientific discovery. They are using the ideas around machine learning modelling to drive their scientific research.}

\notes{For example, [Bingqing Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/tonicbq/), one of the Department's new DECAF Fellows  has used neural network accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to understand a new form of metallic hydrogen, likely to occur at the heart of stars [@Cheng-evidence20].

\subsection{Surrogate Models and Emulators}

\notes{There are a number of ways we can use machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery. But one way is to have the machine learning model learn the effect of the rules. Rather than worrying about the detail of the rules through coputing each step, we can have the machine learning model look to abstract the rules and capture emergent phenomena, just as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution captures the essence of the behaviour of the ideal gas.}

\notes{In the papers listed above, neural networks are being used to speed up computations. In this course we've introduced Gaussian processes that will be used to speed up these computations. In both cases the ideas are similar. Rather than rerunning the simulation, we use data from the simulation to *fit* the neural network or the Gaussian process to the data.}

\notes{We'll see an example of how this is done in a moment, taken from a simple ride hailing simulator, but before we look at that, we'll first consider why this might be a useful approach.}

\include{_simulation/includes/game-of-life.md}


\section{Modelling in Practice}

\notes{As we've seen from the very simple rules in the Game of Life, emergent phenomena we might be interested in take computation power to discover, just as Laplace's and Dirac's quotes suggest. The objective in surrogate modelling is to harness machine learning models to learn those physical characteristics.}

\subsection{Types of Simulations}

\notes{We've introduced simulations from the perspective of laws of physics. In practice, many simulations may not directly encode for the laws of physics, but they might encode expert intuitions about a problem. 

For example, in Formula 1 races, the cars have tyres that wear at different rates. Softer tyres allow the cars to drive faster, but wear quicker. Harder tyres man the car drives slower but they last longer. Changing between tyres is part of the race, and it has a time penalty. Before each race the teams decide what their strategy will be with tyre changes. It's not only how many tyre changes that are important, but when they happen. If you change your tyre early, you might get a speed advantage and be able to pass your rival when they change their tyre later. This is a trick known as 'undercutting', but if your early change puts you back onto the track behind other slower cars, you will loose this advantage. }

\notes{Formula 1 teams determine their strategy through simulating the race. Each team knows how fast other teams are around the track, and what their top speeds are. So the teams simulate many thousands or millions of races with different strategies for their rivals, and they choose the strategy for which they maximize their number of expected points.}

\notes{When many simulations are done, the results take time to come. During the actual race, the simulations are too slow to provide the real time information teams would need. In this case F1 teams can use emulators, models that have learnt the effect of the simulations, to give real time updates}

\notes{Formula 1 race simulations contain assumptions that derive from physics but don't directly encode the physical laws. For example, if one car is stuck behind another, in any given lap, it might overtake. A typical race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed of each car (as measured in 'speed traps' that are placed on the straight). It will assume a probability of overtake for each lap that is a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from their knowledge and previous experience.}

\notes{Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can lead to challenges. I once asked a strategy engineer, who had completed a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started out well, but over time its performance was degrading. We discussed this for a while and over time a challenge of misspecified granularity emerged.}

\subsection{Fidelity of the Simulation}

\slides{* Simulations work at different fidelities.
     * e.g. difference between strategy simulation in F1 and aerodynamics simulation}

\notes{The engineer explained how there'd been a race where the simulation had suggested that their main driver *shouldn't* pit because he would have emerged behind a car with a slower lap speed, but a high top speed. This would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of that slower car was also in the team's 'development program', so every one in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to let their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn't know this. So the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the race, the simulation was updated to include a special case for this situation. The new code checked whether the slower car was a development driver, making it 'more realistic'.

Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now 'mixing granularities'. The formula for computing the probability of over take as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether or not a given driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not, whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That's all assimilated into the equation. The original equation is easy to calibrate, but as soon as you move to a finer granularity and consider more details about indvidual drivers, the model seems more realistic but it becomes difficult to specify, and therefore performance degrades.}

\notes{Simulations work at different fidelities, but as the Formula 1 example shows you have to be very careful about mixing fidelities within the same simulation. The appropriate fidelity of a simulation is strongly dependent on the question being asked of it. On the context. For example, in Formula 1 races you can also simulate the performance of the car in the wind tunnel and using computational fluid dynamics represenations of the Navier Stokes equations. That level of fidelity *is* appropriate when designing the aerodynamic components of the car, but inappropriate when building a strategy simulation.}

\section{Epidemiology}

\notes{The same concept of modelling at a particular fidelity comes up in epidemiology. In reality, disease is transmitted by direct person to person interactions between individuals. But in theoretical epidemiology, this is approximated by differential equations. The resulting models look very similar to reaction rate models used in Chemistry for well mixed beakers. Let's have a look at a simple example used for modelling the policy of 'herd immunity' for Covid19.}

\include{_simulation/includes/herd-immunity.md}

\notes{Thinking about our Formula 1 example, and the differing levels of fidelity that might be included in a model, you can now imagine the challenges of doing large scale theoretical epidemiology. The compartment model is operating at a particular level of fidelity. Imagine trying to modify this model for a specific circumstance, like the way that the University of Cambridge chooses to do lectures. It's not appropriate for this level of fidelity. You need to use different types of models for that decision making. Later, we'll look at a simulation that was used to advise the government on the Test Trace Isolate program that took a different approach.}

\section{Strategies for Simulation}

\notes{Within any simulation, we can roughly split the variables of interest into the state variables and the parameters. In the Herd immunity example, the state variables were the different susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered groups. The parameters were the reproduction number and the expected lengths of infection and the timing of lockdown. Often parameters are viewed as the inputs to the simulation, the things we can control. We might want to know how to time lock down to minimize the number of deaths. This behaviour of the simulator is what we may want to emulate with our Gaussian process model.}

\notes{So far we've introduced simulation motivated by the physical laws of the universe. Those laws are sometimes encoded in differential equations, in which case we can try to solve those systems (like with Herd Immunity or Navier Stokes). An alternative approach is taken in the Game of Life. There a turn based simulation is used, at each turn, we iterate through the simulation updating the sate of the simulation. This is known as a *discrete event simulation*. In race simulation for Formula 1 a discrete event simulation is also used. There is another form of discrete event simulation, often used in Chemical models, where the events don't take place at regular intervals. Instead, the timing to the next event is computed, and the simulator advances that amount of time. For an example of this see [the Gillespie algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm)}.

\notes{There is a third type of simulation that we'd also like to introduce. That is simulation within computer software. In particular, the need to backtest software with 'what if' ideas, or to trace errors that may have occured in production. This can involve loading up entire code bases and rerunning them with simulated inputs. This is a third form of simulation where emulation can also come in useful.}

\subsection{Backtesting Production Code}

\notes{In Amazon the team I led looked at examples of simulations and emulation as varied as Prime Air drones across to the Amazon Supply Chain. In a purchasing system, the idea is to store stock so as to balance supply and demand. The aim is to keep product in stock for quick despatch while keeping prices (and therefore costs) low. This idea is at the heart of Amazon's focus on customer experience.}

\notes{Modern software development uses an approach known as *service oriented architecture* to build highly complex systems. Such systems have similar emergent properties to Conway's "Game of Life". Understanding these emergent properties is vitally important when diagnosing problems in the system.}

\notes{In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan Zittrain has coined the term ["Intellectual Debt"](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c) to describe the challenge of understanding what you've created.}

\notes{Clearly Conway's Game of Life exhibits an enormous amount of intellectual debt, indeed that was the idea. Build something simple that exhibits great complexity. That's what makes it so popular. But in deployed system software, intellectual debt is a major headache and emulation presents one way of dealing with it.}

\include{_ai/includes/buying-system.md}

\notes{Unfortunately it also makes sophisticated software systems a breeding ground for intellectual debt. Particularly when they contain components which are themselves ML components. Dealing with this challenge is a major objective of my Senior AI Fellowship at the Alan Turing Institute. You can see me talking about the problems [at this recent seminar given virtually in Manchester](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/deploying-machine-learning-systems-intellectual-debt-and-auto-ai.html).}

\section{Related Approaches}

\notes{While this module is mainly focussing on emulation as a route to bringing machine learning closer to the physical world, I don't want to give the impression that's the only approach. In particular, it's worth bearing in mind three important domains of machine learning (and statistics) that we also could have explored.}

* Probabilistic Programming
* Approximate Bayesian Computation
* Causal inference

\notes{Each of these domains also brings a lot to the table in terms of understanding the physical world.}

\subsection{Probabilistic Programming}
\slides{* Dates back to BUGS
* Modern descendent (same spirit) is Stan
* Also languages like pyro (based on PyTorch)
}

\notes{Probabilistic programming is an idea that, from our perspective, can be summarized as follows. What if, when constructing your simulator, or your model, you used a programming language that was aware of the state variables and the probability distributions. What if this language could 'compile' the program into code that would automatically compute the Bayesian posterior for you?

This is the objective of probabilistic programming. The idea is that you write your model in a language, and that language is automatically converted into the different modelling codes you need to perform Bayesian inference.

The ideas for probabilistic programming originate in [BUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/). The software was developed at the MRC Biostatistics Unit here in Cambridge in the early 1990s, by amoung others, David Spiegelhalter. Carl Henrik covered in last week's lecture some of the approaches for approximate inference. BUGS uses Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling, however, can be slow to converge when there are strong correlations in the posterior between variables. 

The descendent of BUGS that is probably most similar in the spirit of its design is [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). Stan came from researchers at Columbia University and makes use of a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo called the No-U-Turn sampler. It builds on automatic differentiation for the gradients it needs. It's all written in C++ for speed, but has interfaces to Python, R, Julia, Matlab etc. Stan has been higly succesful during the Coronavirus pandemic, with a number of epidemiological simulations written in the language, for example see this [blog post](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/boarding_school_case_study.html).}

\notes{Other probabilistic programming languages of interest include those that make use of variational approaches (such as [pyro](https://pyro.ai/)) and allow use of neural network components.}

\subsection{Approximate Bayesian Computation}

\notes{We reintroduced Gaussian processes at the start of this lecture by sampling from the Gaussian process and matching the samples to data, discarding those that were distant from our observations. This approach to Bayesian inference is the starting point for *approximate Bayesian computation* or ABC.}

\notes{The idea is straightforward, if we can measure 'closeness' in some relevant fashion, then we can sample from our simulation, compare our samples to real world data through 'closeness measure' and eliminate samples that are distant from our data. Through appropriate choice of closeness measure, our samples can be viewed as coming from an approximate posterior.}

\notes{My Sheffield colleague, Rich Wilkinson, was one of the pioneers of this approach during his PhD in the Statslab here in Cambridge. You can hear Rich talking about ABC at NeurIPS in 2013 here.}

\notes{All of these approaches offer a lot of promise for developing machine learning at the interface with science, but covering each in detail would require four separate modules. We've chosen to focus on the emulation approach, for two princpal reasons. Firstly, it's conceptual simplicity. Our aim is to replace all or part of our simulation with a machine learning model. Typically, we're going to want uncertainties as part of that representation. That explains our focus on Gaussian process models. Secondly, the emulator method is flexible. Probabilistic programming requires that the simulator has been built in a particular way, otherwise we can't compile the program. Finally, the emulation approach can be combined with any of the existing simulation approaches. For example, we might want to write our emulators as probabilistic programs. Or we might do causal analysis on our emulators, or we could speed up the simulation in ABC through emulation.}

\notes{We've introduced the notion of a simulator. A body of computer code that expresses our understanding of a particular physical system. We introduced such simulators through *physical laws*, such as laws of gravitation or electro-magnetism. But we soon saw that in may simulations those laws become abstracted and the simulation becomes more phenomological.}

\notes{Even full knowledge of all laws does not give us access to 'the mind of God', because we are lacking information about the data, and we are missing the compute. These challenges further motivate the need for abstraction, and we've seen examples of where such abstractions are used in practice.}

\notes{We also summarized the different types of simmulation into roughly three groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly, discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a 'clock', where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event simulation that doesn't use a turn based approach, but waits for the next event. The [Gillespie algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an example of such an approach but we didn't cover it here. Finally, we realised that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a company has a large body of code, and particularly if it's hosted within a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it's possible to back test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code that manages Amazon's automated buying systems) the back tests can be slow and could also benefit from emulation.}
