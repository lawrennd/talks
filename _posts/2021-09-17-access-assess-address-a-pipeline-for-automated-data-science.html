title: "Access, Assess and Address: A Pipeline for (Automated?) Data Science"
venue: "ECML Workshop on Automating Data Science"
abstract: "<p>Data Science is an emerging discipline that is being promoted as a universal panacea for the world’s desire to make better informed decisions based on the wealth of data that is available in our modern interconnected society. In practice data science projects often find it difficult to deliver. In this talk we will review efforts to drive data informed in real world examples, e.g., the UK’s early Covid19 pandemic response. We will introduce a framework for categorising the stages and challenges of the data science pipeline and relate it to the challenges we see when giving data driven answers to real world questions. We will speculate on where automation may be able to help but emphasise that automation in this landscape is challenging when so many issues remain for getting humans to do the job well.</p>"
