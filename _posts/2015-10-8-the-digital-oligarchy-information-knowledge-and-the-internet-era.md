abstract: |
  The data revolution is among us and the technical press is filled with
  stories of big data and artificial intelligence. What is driving this
  progress? In this talk we will argue that collection of data on its own
  is of little utility, it is interconnection of data that allows
  information to become knowledge. Businesses need to place data at the
  core of what they do to benefit from these techniques. The talk will be
  grounded in academic ideas of what information, knowledge and data are.
  But these concepts have practical utility that can influence decision
  making on where data sits within an organisation.
