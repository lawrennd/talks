title: "Intelligent Machines and Humans"
subtitle: The Atomic Human Perspective
abstract: |
  By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
  Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and
  limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
  by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or
  we become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose
  the future we want.

  This session will introduce the ideas in the Atomic Human and turn them over to a Q&A session.
