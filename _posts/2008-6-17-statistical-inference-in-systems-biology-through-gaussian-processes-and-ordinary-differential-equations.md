:abstract: In this talk we will summarise recent work from our group in Manchester
  on inferring `latent biochemical species' in biological systems using Gaussian processes
  and differential equations. A key problem in biological data is when particular
  biochemical species of interest are not directly measurable. We will show how the
  framework of Gaussian processes can be brought to bear on the problem and values
  of latent chemical species can be inferred given data and a differential equation
  model.
