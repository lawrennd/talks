title: "The Atomic Human"
venue: "Vector Institute, Toronto"
abstract: "<p>A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re
having about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our
identity?</p>
<p>Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI not
only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied
threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the
centre of the world.</p>
<p>Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components: eventually
we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek for uncuttable is
‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the facets of human
intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI uncovers what is left:
an indivisible core that is the essence of humanity.</p>
<p>I’ll contrast our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
with the capabilities of machine intelligence and speculate on what it
means for our futures.</p>
<p>This talk is based on Neil’s forthcoming book to be published with
Allen Lane in June 2024.</p>"

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lawrence:embodiment17">Lawrence (2017)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data

computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction

<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest
Hemingway, “For sale: baby shoes, never worn”. To understand what that
means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context
that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the
evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize
both the implication of the advert and what that implication means
emotionally to the previous owner.</p>

<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A
computer cannot understand the depth of the Ernest Hemingway’s
apocryphal six-word novel: “For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never worn”, because
it isn’t equipped with that ability to model the complexity of humanity
that underlies that statement.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially develoepd for people as a recordd of who owed what
to whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

<p><strong>User</strong>: Hi ChatGPT, Could you write soliloquy that
introduces what a Large Language Model is as spoken by Mercutio?</p>
<p><strong>Machine</strong>: Ah, friends, lend me your ears, I prithee,
For now I must utter a tale of wonder, Of a creation divine, called the
Large Language Model, An oracle, a sorcerer, a wordsmith, yea verily, a
master of the quill.</p>
<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own
hand, To mimic our thoughts, our voice, our very essence.</p>
<p>A thousand minds, nay, a millionfold, Conjoined in this digital
Athenaeum, Words and phrases, like soldiers in battle, Marching to form
the verses of our age.</p>
<p>This Large Language Model, a changeling so fair, Hath the power to
bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this
digital bard, And mayhaps, by its grace, we shall glean some wisdom, As
we wander together, hand in hand, Through this boundless realm of
knowledge and wonder.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology development with public interests demands effective stakeholder engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology design.

Building this pipeline will take coordination across research, engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible solutions.

## Making AI equitable





AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.

This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.

The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations.

AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal benefit and mitigate social harm.

In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research ecosystem.

<!-- AI Fallacy -->
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>One of the struggles of artificial intelligence is that the term
means different things to different people. Our intelligence is precious
to us, and the notion that it can be easily recreated is disturbing to
us. This leads to some dystopian notions of artificial intelligence,
such as the singularity.</p>
<p>Depending on whether this powerful technology is viewed as beneficent
or maleficent, it can be viewed either as a helpful assistant, in the
manner of Jeeves, or a tyrannical dictator.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>The history of automation and technology is a history of us adapting
to technological change. The invention of the railways, and the need for
consistent national times to timetable our movements. The development of
the factory system in the mills of Derbyshire required workers to
operate and maintain the machines that replaced them.</p>
<p>Listening to modern to conversations about artificial intelligence, I
think the use of the term <em>intelligence</em> has given rise to an
idea that this technology will be the But amoung these different
assessments of artificial intelligence is buried an idea, one that will
be the first technology to adapt to us.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is
not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across
society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of this because from 2015 to 2017 I was on the Working
Group that compiled the Royal Society’s machine learning report. The
process of constructing the report went across the UK Referendum, and
the 2016 US election. I remember vividly a meeting we convened at the
Society in London which had experts alongside MPs from all parties,
policy advisors and civil servants. One of the MPs (likely correctly)
pointed out “I suspect no one around this table voted for Brexit” to
which I replied “But isn’t that the problem? There are a large number of
people who aren’t empowered who are experiencing quite a different
reality than us. And they aren’t reprented in these forums.” So it’s no
surprise that so much of the press conversation around AI is still
focussed on how it is likely to effect middle class jobs. We shouldn’t
underestimate these effects, but it’s often the case that better
educated people are better placed to deal with such challenges. For
example, when stock brokers’ roles disappeared they simply moved on to
other roles in banks and related industries.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of
explanation that come with AI is Intellectual Debt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan
Zittrain has coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">“Intellectual
Debt”</a> to describe the challenge of understanding what you’ve
created. In <a
href="https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/data-oriented-architectures-for-ai-based-systems.html">the
ML@CL group we’ve been foucssing on developing the notion of a
<em>data-oriented architecture</em></a> to deal with intellectual debt
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cabrera-realworld23">(Cabrera et al.,
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability
of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine
learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and
transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if
we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe
this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining
regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”.
Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it
feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual,
because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation
task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting
individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can
linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual
tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore
fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>
<h2 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt</h2>
<p>In computer systems the concept of <em>technical debt</em> has been
surfaced by authors including <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sculley:debt15">Sculley et al. (2015)</span>. It is an
important concept, that I think is somewhat hidden from the academic
community, because it is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer
software system is deployed.</p>

</div>
<p>To construct such complex systems an approach known as “separation of
concerns” has been developed. The idea is that you architect your
system, which consists of a large-scale complex task, into a set of
simpler tasks. Each of these tasks is separately implemented. This is
known as the decomposition of the task.</p>
<p>This is where Jonathan Zittrain’s beautifully named term
“intellectual debt” rises to the fore. Separation of concerns enables
the construction of a complex system. But who is concerned with the
overall system?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical debt is the inability to <em>maintain</em> your complex
software system.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual debt is the inability to <em>explain</em> your
software system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is right there in our approach to software engineering.
“Separation of concerns” means no one is concerned about the overall
system itself.</p>

<p>In the UK we saw these effects play out in the Horizon scandal: the
accounting system of the national postal service was computerized by
Fujitsu and first installed in 1999, but neither the Post Office nor
Fujitsu were able to control the system they had deployed. When it went
wrong individual sub postmasters were blamed for the systems’ errors.
Over the next two decades they were prosecuted and jailed leaving lives
ruined in the wake of the machine’s mistakes.</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back from artificial intelligence, and consider
natural intelligence. Or even more generally, let’s consider the
contrast between an artificial <em>system</em> and an natural system.
The key difference between the two is that artificial systems are
<em>designed</em> whereas natural systems are <em>evolved</em>.</p>
<p>Systems design is a major component of all Engineering disciplines.
The details differ, but there is a single common theme: achieve your
objective with the minimal use of resources to do the job. That provides
efficiency. The engineering designer imagines a solution that requires
the minimal set of components to achieve the result. A water pump has
one route through the pump. That minimises the number of components
needed. Redundancy is introduced only in safety critical systems, such
as aircraft control systems. Students of biology, however, will be aware
that in nature system-redundancy is everywhere. Redundancy leads to
robustness. For an organism to survive in an evolving environment it
must first be robust, then it can consider how to be efficient. Indeed,
organisms that evolve to be too efficient at a particular task, like
those that occupy a niche environment, are particularly vulnerable to
extinction.</p>
<p>This notion is akin to the idea that only the best will survive,
popularly encoded into an notion of evolution by Herbert Spencer’s
quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival of the fittest</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Herbet
Spencer</a>, 1864</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin himself never said “Survival of the Fittest” he talked about
evolution by natural selection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-survival of the non-fit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolution is better described as “non-survival of the non-fit”. You
don’t have to be the fittest to survive, you just need to avoid the
pitfalls of life. This is the first priority.</p>
<p>So it is with natural vs artificial intelligences. Any natural
intelligence that was not robust to changes in its external environment
would not survive, and therefore not reproduce. In contrast the
artificial intelligences we produce are designed to be efficient at one
specific task: control, computation, playing chess. They are
<em>fragile</em>.</p>
<p>The first rule of a natural system is not be intelligent, it is
“don’t be stupid”.</p>
<p>A mistake we make in the design of our systems is to equate fitness
with the objective function, and to assume it is known and static. In
practice, a real environment would have an evolving fitness function
which would be unknown at any given time.</p>
<p>You can also read this blog post on <a
href="http://inverseprobability.com/2018/02/06/natural-and-artificial-intelligence">Natural
and Artificial Intelligence</a>..</p>
<p>The first criterion of a natural intelligence is <em>don’t fail</em>,
not because it has a will or intent of its own, but because if it had
failed it wouldn’t have stood the test of time. It would no longer
exist. In contrast, the mantra for artificial systems is to be more
efficient. Our artificial systems are often given a single objective (in
machine learning it is encoded in a mathematical function) and they aim
to achieve that objective efficiently. These are different
characteristics. Even if we wanted to incorporate <em>don’t fail</em> in
some form, it is difficult to design for. To design for “don’t fail”,
you have to consider every which way in which things can go wrong, if
you miss one you fail. These cases are sometimes called corner cases.
But in a real, uncontrolled environment, almost everything is a corner.
It is difficult to imagine everything that can happen. This is why most
of our automated systems operate in controlled environments, for example
in a factory, or on a set of rails. Deploying automated systems in an
uncontrolled environment requires a different approach to systems
design. One that accounts for uncertainty in the environment and is
robust to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="todays-artificial-systems">Today’s Artificial Systems</h2>
<p>The systems we produce today only work well when their tasks are
pigeonholed, bounded in their scope. To achieve robust artificial
intelligences we need new approaches to both the design of the
individual components, and the combination of components within our AI
systems. We need to deal with uncertainty and increase robustness.
Today, it is easy to make a fool of an artificial intelligent agent,
technology needs to address the challenge of the uncertain environment
to achieve robust intelligences.</p>
<p>However, even if we find technological solutions for these
challenges, it may be that the essence of human intelligence remains out
of reach. It may be that the most quintessential element of our
intelligence is defined by limitations. Limitations that computers have
never experienced.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon developed the idea of information theory: the
mathematics of information. He defined the amount of information we gain
when we learn the result of a coin toss as a “bit” of information. A
typical computer can communicate with another computer with a billion
bits of information per second. Equivalent to a billion coin tosses per
second. So how does this compare to us? Well, we can also estimate the
amount of information in the English language. Shannon estimated that
the average English word contains around 12 bits of information, twelve
coin tosses, this means our verbal communication rates are only around
the order of tens to hundreds of bits per second. Computers communicate
tens of millions of times faster than us, in relative terms we are
constrained to a bit of pocket money, while computers are corporate
billionaires.</p>
<p>Our intelligence is not an island, it interacts, it infers the goals
or intent of others, it predicts our own actions and how we will respond
to others. We are social animals, and together we form a communal
intelligence that characterises our species. For intelligence to be
communal, our ideas to be shared somehow. We need to overcome this
bandwidth limitation. The ability to share and collaborate, despite such
constrained ability to communicate, characterises us. We must
intellectually commune with one another. We cannot communicate all of
what we saw, or the details of how we are about to react. Instead, we
need a shared understanding. One that allows us to infer each other’s
intent through context and a common sense of humanity. This
characteristic is so strong that we anthropomorphise any object with
which we interact. We apply moods to our cars, our cats, our
environment. We seed the weather, volcanoes, trees with intent. Our
desire to communicate renders us intellectually animist.</p>
<p>But our limited bandwidth doesn’t constrain us in our imaginations.
Our consciousness, our sense of self, allows us to play out different
scenarios. To internally observe how our self interacts with others. To
learn from an internal simulation of the wider world. Empathy allows us
to understand others’ likely responses without having the full detail of
their mental state. We can infer their perspective. Self-awareness also
allows us to understand our own likely future responses, to look forward
in time, play out a scenario. Our brains contain a sense of self and a
sense of others. Because our communication cannot be complete it is both
contextual and cultural. When driving a car in the UK a flash of the
lights at a junction concedes the right of way and invites another road
user to proceed, whereas in Italy, the same flash asserts the right of
way and warns another road user to remain.</p>
<p>Our main intelligence is our social intelligence, intelligence that
is dedicated to overcoming our bandwidth limitation. We are individually
complex, but as a society we rely on shared behaviours and
oversimplification of our selves to remain coherent.</p>
<p>This nugget of our intelligence seems impossible for a computer to
recreate directly, because it is a consequence of our evolutionary
history. The computer, on the other hand, was born into a world of data,
of high bandwidth communication. It was not there through the genesis of
our minds and the cognitive compromises we made are lost to time. To be
a truly human intelligence you need to have shared that journey with
us.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this prevents us emulating those aspects of human
intelligence that we observe in humans. We can form those emulations
based on data. But even if an artificial intelligence can emulate humans
to a high degree of accuracy it is a different type of intelligence. It
is not constrained in the way human intelligence is. You may ask does it
matter? Well, it is certainly important to us in many domains that
there’s a human pulling the strings. Even in pure commerce it matters:
the narrative story behind a product is often as important as the
product itself. Handmade goods attract a price premium over factory
made. Or alternatively in entertainment: people pay more to go to a live
concert than for streaming music over the internet. People will also pay
more to go to see a play in the theatre rather than a movie in the
cinema.</p>
<p>In many respects I object to the use of the term Artificial
Intelligence. It is poorly defined and means different things to
different people. But there is one way in which the term is very
accurate. The term artificial is appropriate in the same way we can
describe a plastic plant as an artificial plant. It is often difficult
to pick out from afar whether a plant is artificial or not. A plastic
plant can fulfil many of the functions of a natural plant, and plastic
plants are more convenient. But they can never replace natural
plants.</p>
<p>In the same way, our natural intelligence is an evolved thing of
beauty, a consequence of our limitations. Limitations which don’t apply
to artificial intelligences and can only be emulated through artificial
means. Our natural intelligence, just like our natural landscapes,
should be treasured and can never be fully replaced.</p>

<p>Classical systems design assumes that the system is decomposable.
That we can decompose the complex decision making process into distinct
and independently designable parts. The composition of these parts gives
us our final system.</p>

write a column called ‘bits and atoms’. This referred to the ability of
information to effect movement of goods in the physical world. It is

services are producing.</p>

<p>Naval gunnery systems deal with targeting guns while taking into
account movement of ships. The Royal Navy’s Gunnery Pocket Book <span
class="citation" data-cites="Admiralty-gunnery45">(The Admiralty,
1945)</span> gives details of one system for gun laying.</p>
<p>Like many challenges we face today, in the second world war, fire
control was handled by a hybrid system of humans and computers. This
means deploying human beings for the tasks that they can manage, and
machines for the tasks that are better performed by a machine. This
leads to a division of labour between the machine and the human that can
still be found in our modern digital ecosystems.</p>

the Eye</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Mackay-behind91">(MacKay,
1991)</span> summarises MacKay’s Gifford Lectures, where MacKay uses the
operation of the eye as a window on the operation of the brain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Donald MacKay was at King’s College for his PhD. He was just down the
road from Bill Phillips at LSE who was building the MONIAC. He was part
of the Ratio Club. A group of early career scientists who were
interested in communication and control in animals and humans, or more
specifically they were interested in computers and brains. The were part
of an international movement known as cybernetics.</p>
<p>Donald MacKay wrote of the influence that his own work on radar had
on his interest in the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… during the war I had worked on the theory of automated and
electronic computing and on the theory of information, all of which are
highly relevant to such things as automatic pilots and automatic gun
direction. I found myself grappling with problems in the design of
artificial sense organs for naval gun-directors and with the principles
on which electronic circuits could be used to simulate situations in the
external world so as to provide goal-directed guidance for ships,
aircraft, missiles and the like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Later in the 1940’s, when I was doing my Ph.D. work, there was much
talk of the brain as a computer and of the early digital computers that
were just making the headlines as “electronic brains.” As an analogue
computer man I felt strongly convinced that the brain, whatever it was,
was not a digital computer. I didn’t think it was an analogue computer
either in the conventional sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this naturally rubbed under my skin the question: well, if it is
not either of these, what kind of system is it? Is there any way of
following through the kind of analysis that is appropriate to their
artificial automata so as to understand better the kind of system the
human brain is? That was the beginning of my slippery slope into brain
research.</p>
<p><em>Behind the Eye</em> pg 40. Edited version of the 1986 Gifford
Lectures given by Donald M. MacKay and edited by Valerie MacKay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the <em>analogue</em>
computer and the <em>digital</em> computer. As he mentions, his
experience was with analogue machines. An analogue machine is
<em>literally</em> an analogue. The radar systems that Wiener and MacKay
both worked on were made up of electronic components such as resistors,
capacitors, inductors and/or mechanical components such as cams and
gears. Together these components could represent a physical system, such
as an anti-aircraft gun and a plane. The design of the analogue computer
required the engineer to simulate the real world in analogue
electronics, using dualities that exist between e.g. mechanical circuits
(mass, spring, damper) and electronic circuits (inductor, resistor,
capacitor). The analogy between mass and a damper, between spring and a
resistor and between capacitor and a damper works because the underlying
mathematics is approximated with the same linear system: a second order
differential equation. This mathematical analogy allowed the designer to
map from the real world, through mathematics, to a virtual world where
the components reflected the real world through analogy.</p>

<p>The machine learning systems we have built today that can reconstruct
human text, or human classification of images, necessarily must have
some aspects to them that are analagous to our understanding. As MacKay
suggests the brain is neither a digital or an analogue computer, and the
same can be said of the modern neural network systems that are being
tagged as “artificial intelligence”.</p>
<p>I believe a better term for them is “human-analogue machines”,
because what we have built is not a system that can make intelligent
decisions from first principles (a rational approach) but one that
observes how humans have made decisions through our data and
reconstructs that process. Machine learning is more empiricist than
rational, but now we n empirical approach that distils our evolved
intelligence.</p>

Our interpretation of these objects as showing motives and even emotion
is a combination of our desire for narrative, a need for understanding

crudely drawn objects, but in another way, the animator has communicated
a story through simple facets such as their relative motions, their
sizes and their actions. We apply our psychological representations to
these faceless shapes to interpret their actions.</p>

<p>By interacting directly with machines that have an understanding of

uncertainty in the same way humans do. See for example the paper <a

without special training. This in turn offers the opportunity to
overcome the challenge of <em>intellectual debt</em>.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, they
allow us access to what the machine is doing in a way that bypasses many
of the traditional techniques developed in statistics. But understanding
this new route for access is a major new challenge.</p>
