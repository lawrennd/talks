title: Lies Damned Lies and Big Data
abstract: There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and big data. Weâ€™re entering
  a new era of misrepresentation, but these challenges are not new. Humans are easily
  misled, but some basic skepticism and attention to detail can keep us on top of
  the new challenges we face. In this talk will give some hints and tips on how to
  progress.
