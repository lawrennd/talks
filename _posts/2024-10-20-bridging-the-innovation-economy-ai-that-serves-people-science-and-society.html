<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of technology is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, technology is presented as
an elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of technology into practical benefit is not
simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from innovations are unevenly distributed across society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, technology risks exacerbating existing
social and economic inequalities.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially developed for people as a record of who owed what to
whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>The feel of an aircraft is a repeated theme in the early years of
flight. In response to perceived European advances in flight in the
First World War, the US introduced the National Advisory Committee on
Aeronautics. Under the committee a proving ground for aircraft was
formed at Langley Field in Virginia. During the Second World War Bob
Gilruth published a report on the <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930091834">flying qualities
of aircraft</a> that characterised how this feel could be translated
into numbers.</p>

p. 163–168. One of Gilruth’s collaborators suggested that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawker Hurricane airplane. A heavily armed fighter airplane noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane’s flying qualities were
found to be generally satisfactory. The most notable deficiencies were
heavy aileron forces at high speeds and large friction in the
controls.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supermarine Spitfire airplane. A high-performance fighter noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain and throughout WW II, the Spitfire had
desirably light elevator control forces in maneuvers and near neutral
longitudinal stability. Its greatest deficiency from the combat
standpoint was heavy aileron forces and sluggish roll response at high
speeds.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilruth went beyond the reports of feel to characterise how the plane
should respond to different inputs on the control stick. In other words
he quantified that feel of the plane.</p>
<p>Gilrtuth’s work was in the spirit of Lord Kelvin’s quote on
measurement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in
numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in
numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may
be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts
advanced to the stage of science.</p>
<p>From Chapter 3, pg 73 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Thomson-popular89">Thomson (1889)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim was to convert a qualitative property of aircraft into
quantitative measurement, thereby allowing their improvement.</p>

<p>Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology
design.</p>
<p>Building this pipeline will take coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.</p>
<h2 id="supply-chain-of-ideas">Supply Chain of Ideas</h2>
<p>Model is “supply chain of ideas” framework, particularly in the
context of information technology and AI solutions like machine learning
and large language models. You suggest that this idea flow, from
creation to application, is similar to how physical goods move through
economic supply chains.</p>
<p>In the realm of IT solutions, there’s been an overemphasis on
macro-economic “supply-side” stimulation - focusing on creating new
technologies and ideas - without enough attention to the micro-economic
“demand-side” - understanding and addressing real-world needs and
challenges.</p>
<p>Imagining the supply chain rather than just the notion of the
Innovation Economy allows the conceptualisation of the gaps between
macro and micro economic issues, enabling a different way of thinking
about process innovation.</p>

<p>In the UK we saw these effects play out in the Horizon scandal: the
accounting system of the national postal service was computerized by
Fujitsu and first installed in 1999, but neither the Post Office nor
Fujitsu were able to control the system they had deployed. When it went
wrong individual sub postmasters were blamed for the systems’ errors.
Over the next two decades they were prosecuted and jailed leaving lives
ruined in the wake of the machine’s mistakes.</p>

<p>One quote from 16:54:33 in the committee discussion captures the
top-down nature of the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q117 Austin Mitchell: You said, Sir David, the problems came from the
middle range, but surely they were implicit from the start, because this
project was rushed into. The Prime Minister [Tony Blair] was very keen,
the delivery unit was very keen, it was very fashionable to computerise
things like this. An appendix indicating the cost would be £5 billion
was missed out of the original report as published, so you have a very
high estimate there in the first place. Then, Richard Granger, the
Director of IT, rushed through, without consulting the professions. This
was a kind of computer enthusiast’s bit, was it not? The professionals
who were going to have to work it were not consulted, because
consultation would have made it clear that they were going to ask more
from it and expect more from it, and then contracts for £1 billion were
let pretty well straightaway, in May 2003. That was very quick. Now, why
were the contracts let before the professionals were consulted?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An analysis of the problems was published by <span class="citation"
data-cites="Justinia-npfit17">Justinia (2017)</span>. Based on the
paper, the key challenges faced in the UK’s National Programme for IT
(NPfIT) included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lack of adequate end user engagement, particularly with frontline
healthcare staff and patients. The program was imposed from the top-down
without securing buy-in from stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Absence of a phased change management approach. The
implementation was rushed without proper planning for organizational and
cultural changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Underestimating the scale and complexity of the project. The
centralized, large-scale approach was overambitious and difficult to
manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor project management, including unrealistic timetables, lack
of clear leadership, and no exit strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient attention to privacy and security concerns regarding
patient data.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of local ownership. The centralized approach meant local
healthcare providers felt no ownership over the systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication issues, including poor communication with frontline
staff about the program’s benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical problems, delays in delivery, and unreliable
software.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to recognize the socio-cultural challenges were as
significant as the technical ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of flexibility to adapt to changing requirements over the
long timescale.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient resources and inadequate methodologies for
implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Low morale among NHS staff responsible for implementation due to
uncertainties and unrealistic timetables.</p></li>
<li><p>Conflicts between political objectives and practical
implementation needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The paper emphasizes that while technical competence is necessary,
the organizational, human, and change management factors were more
critical to the program’s failure than purely technological issues. The
top-down, centralized approach and lack of stakeholder engagement were
particularly problematic.</p>

<p>Key points: Both cases demonstrate a significant gap between
high-level policy decisions (macro) and on-the-ground realities
(micro).</p>
<ul>
<li>The failures stemmed from insufficient consideration of local needs,
capabilities, and existing systems.</li>
<li>There was a lack of effective feedback mechanisms from the micro to
macro level.</li>
<li>The implementations suffered from overly rigid, top-down approaches
that didn’t allow for local adaptation.</li>

<h2 id="bridging">Bridging</h2>
<p>These examples provide valuable lessons for bridging the macro-micro
gap in innovation: * The importance of stakeholder engagement at all
levels. * The need for flexibility and adaptability in system design and
implementation. * The crucial role of effective feedback mechanisms. *
The value of phased implementation approaches. * The necessity of
ensuring technical competence at both policy-making and implementation
levels. * The importance of setting realistic timelines based on
technical and operational realities. * The potential benefit of
independent, technically competent oversight.</p>

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated
decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data
there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but
also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for
targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to
identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual
selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The feudal system that is implied by current data protection
legislation has significant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the
data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data
subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too
late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often
their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but
that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>
<p><a

Data Trusts</a> <span class="citation"

and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a
potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em>
that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to
the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organization
where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees’
responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the
motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the
data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under
which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would
be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of
individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the
Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded
with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily
involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems
clear that we need to better characterize the data sharing landscape as
well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data
sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it
feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be
taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider
negotiations.</p>

<p>We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning, but
need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field machine
learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle some complex,
‘real world’ problems.</p>
<p>It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has started
the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new Programme is
seeking to support researchers across the University to develop the
skills they need to be able to use machine learning and AI in their
research.</p>
<p>To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops and
applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific challenges,
with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on issues
relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While
we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for now, in the longer term our
ambition is to build links with the social sciences and humanities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recruited a core research team working on the application of AI
in mental health, bioinformatics, healthcare, string theory, and complex
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Created a research agenda and roadmap for the development of AI
in science.</p></li>
<li><p>Funded 9 interdisciplinary projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Antimicrobial resistance in farming</p></li>
<li><p>Quantifying Design Trade-offs in Electricity-generation-focused
Tokamaks using AI</p></li>
<li><p>Automated preclinical drug discovery in vivo using pose
estimation</p></li>
<li><p>Causal Methods for Environmental Science Workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic tree mapping in Cambridge</p></li>
<li><p>Acoustic monitoring for biodiversity conservation</p></li>
<li><p>AI, mathematics and string theory</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretical, Scientific, and Philosophical Perspectives on
Biological Understanding in the age of Artificial Intelligence</p></li>
<li><p>AI in pathology: optimising a classifier for digital images of
duodenal biopsies</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a pipeline
of learning opportunities to help PhD students and postdocs better
understand how to use data science and machine learning in their
work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<p>Teaching and learning</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brought over 250 participants from over 30 departments through
tailored data science and machine learning for science training (Data
Science Residency and Machine Learning Academy);</p></li>
<li><p>Convened workshops with over 80 researchers across the University
on the development of data pipelines for science;</p></li>
<li><p>Delivered University courses to over 100 students in Advanced
Data Science and Machine Learning and the Physical World.</p></li>
<li><p>Online training course in Python and Pandas accessed by over 380
researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on machine
learning and the sciences, helping to share best practice and new
methods, and support each other in advancing their research. Over the
coming years, we’ll be running a variety of events and activities in
support of this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Launched a Machine Learning Engineering Clinic that has supported
over 40 projects across the University with MLE troubleshooting and
advice;</p></li>
<li><p>Hosted and participated in events reaching over 300 people in
Cambridge;</p></li>
<li><p>Led international workshops at Dagstuhl and Oberwolfach,
convening over 60 leading researchers;</p></li>
<li><p>Engaged over 70 researchers through outreach sessions and
workshops with the School of Clinical Medicine, the Faculty of
Education, Cambridge Digital Humanities and the School of Biological
Sciences.</p></li>

Conclusion</h2>
<p>ai@cam’s approach aims to address the macro-micro disconnects in AI
innovation. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, engaging
diverse stakeholders, and providing crucial resources and training,
ai@cam is working to create a more integrated and effective AI
innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our emphasis is on flexibility, phased implementation, and continuous
feedback. This is to address the lessons learned from past IT
implementation failures.</p>
<p><em>But</em>: AI technologies and their applications will continue to
evolve rapidly, we will need to remain agile, continuously assessing and
adjusting our strategies to ensure we effectively bridge the gap between
high-level AI capabilities and on-the-ground implementation
challenges.</p>
