title: "AutoAI: Systems, Machine Learning and Mathematics"
abstract: >
  Deployed artificial intelligence solutions consist of interacting components often trained as the result of *supervised machine learning*. Automatic training of these sub-components is known as AutoML. But the real world challenges of deployment consist of the monitoring of system performance in the real world, in terms of accuracy but also for fairness and bias. 
  
  To make such systems easily maintainable there is a need for automation of the process of monitoring and redeploying models as well as checking the quality of the overall system decomposition. 
  
  In contrast to AutoML, we call this system-wide approach "Auto AI". This is the subject of my Turing Fellowship
