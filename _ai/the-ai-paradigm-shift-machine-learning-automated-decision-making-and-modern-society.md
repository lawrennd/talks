title: "The AI Paradigm Shift: Machine Learning, Automated Decision Making and Modern Society"
abstract: |
  The term Artificial Intelligence means different things to different people, but we can distil some commonality across different expectations of the term. It seems that the word intelligence drives us to believe that this new approach to automation will be the first to adapt to us as humans rather than requiring us to adapt to it. This promise presents challenges, because machine learning technologies that underpin the revolution in artificial intelligence are not capable of adapting to humans as we are to each other. In this talk we introduce the challenges and overview the research directions we are taking to uncover the solutions.
