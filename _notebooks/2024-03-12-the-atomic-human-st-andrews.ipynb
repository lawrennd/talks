    "Let’s take a step back from artificial intelligence, and consider\n",

    "contrast between an artificial *system* and an natural system. The key\n",
    "difference between the two is that artificial systems are *designed*\n",
    "whereas natural systems are *evolved*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems design is a major component of all Engineering disciplines. The\n",
    "details differ, but there is a single common theme: achieve your\n",
    "objective with the minimal use of resources to do the job. That provides\n",
    "efficiency. The engineering designer imagines a solution that requires\n",
    "the minimal set of components to achieve the result. A water pump has\n",
    "one route through the pump. That minimises the number of components\n",
    "needed. Redundancy is introduced only in safety critical systems, such\n",
    "as aircraft control systems. Students of biology, however, will be aware\n",
    "that in nature system-redundancy is everywhere. Redundancy leads to\n",
    "robustness. For an organism to survive in an evolving environment it\n",
    "must first be robust, then it can consider how to be efficient. Indeed,\n",
    "organisms that evolve to be too efficient at a particular task, like\n",
    "those that occupy a niche environment, are particularly vulnerable to\n",
    "extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion is akin to the idea that only the best will survive,\n",
    "popularly encoded into an notion of evolution by Herbert Spencer’s\n",
    "quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Survival of the fittest\n",
    ">\n",
    "> [Herbet Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer), 1864\n",

    "evolution by natural selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Non-survival of the non-fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution is better described as “non-survival of the non-fit”. You\n",
    "don’t have to be the fittest to survive, you just need to avoid the\n",
    "pitfalls of life. This is the first priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is with natural vs artificial intelligences. Any natural\n",
    "intelligence that was not robust to changes in its external environment\n",
    "would not survive, and therefore not reproduce. In contrast the\n",
    "artificial intelligences we produce are designed to be efficient at one\n",
    "specific task: control, computation, playing chess. They are *fragile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule of a natural system is not be intelligent, it is “don’t\n",
    "be stupid”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mistake we make in the design of our systems is to equate fitness with\n",
    "the objective function, and to assume it is known and static. In\n",
    "practice, a real environment would have an evolving fitness function\n",
    "which would be unknown at any given time.\n",

    "The first criterion of a natural intelligence is *don’t fail*, not\n",
    "because it has a will or intent of its own, but because if it had failed\n",
    "it wouldn’t have stood the test of time. It would no longer exist. In\n",

    "defined by limitations. Limitations that computers have never\n",

    "Claude Shannon developed the idea of information theory: the mathematics\n",

    "computer can communicate with another computer with a billion bits of\n",
    "information per second. Equivalent to a billion coin tosses per second.\n",
    "So how does this compare to us? Well, we can also estimate the amount of\n",
    "information in the English language. Shannon estimated that the average\n",
    "English word contains around 12 bits of information, twelve coin tosses,\n",
    "this means our verbal communication rates are only around the order of\n",
    "tens to hundreds of bits per second. Computers communicate tens of\n",
    "millions of times faster than us, in relative terms we are constrained\n",
    "to a bit of pocket money, while computers are corporate billionaires.\n",

    "Our intelligence is not an island, it interacts, it infers the goals or\n",
    "intent of others, it predicts our own actions and how we will respond to\n",
    "others. We are social animals, and together we form a communal\n",
    "intelligence that characterises our species. For intelligence to be\n",
    "communal, our ideas to be shared somehow. We need to overcome this\n",
    "bandwidth limitation. The ability to share and collaborate, despite such\n",
    "constrained ability to communicate, characterises us. We must\n",
    "intellectually commune with one another. We cannot communicate all of\n",
    "what we saw, or the details of how we are about to react. Instead, we\n",
    "need a shared understanding. One that allows us to infer each other’s\n",
    "intent through context and a common sense of humanity. This\n",
    "characteristic is so strong that we anthropomorphise any object with\n",
    "which we interact. We apply moods to our cars, our cats, our\n",
    "environment. We seed the weather, volcanoes, trees with intent. Our\n",
    "desire to communicate renders us intellectually animist.\n",

    "allows us to understand our own likely future responses, to look forward\n",

    "overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with the\n",
    "formalization of the field through the development of *mathematical\n",
    "statistics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver little,\n",

    "Balfour and Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th century,\n",

    "The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same sense\n",

    "smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential\n",

    "digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign is a\n",
    "good map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?\n",
    "How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with\n",
    "unreliable data and *unreliable statistics*. The misrepresentations this\n",
    "leads to are worse than the absence of data as they give a false sense\n",

    "pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its value, one that\n",
    "needs to permeate the organization.\n",

    "The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary\n",
    "expertise to digest what the data tells us. Data requires\n",
    "interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is\n",
    "providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made\n",
    "more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by\n",
    "individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the\n",

    "\n",
    "Kappenball is a simple game that illustrates that this behaviour can be\n",
    "optimal. It is inspired by an example in stochastic optimal control by\n",
    "[Bert Kappen](https://www.snn.ru.nl/~bertk/). The game is as follows:\n",
    "you need to place a falling balloon into one of two holes, but if the\n",
    "balloon misses the holes it will pop on pins placed in the ground. In\n",
    "‘deterministic mode’, the balloon falls straight towards the ground and\n",
    "the game is easy. You simply choose which hole to place the ball in, and\n",
    "you can start to place it there as soon as the ball appears at the top\n",
    "of the screen. The game becomes more interesting as you increase the\n",
    "uncertainty. In Kappenball, the uncertainty takes the form of the\n",
    "balloon being blown left and right as it falls. This movement means that\n",
    "it is not sensible to decide early on which hole to place the balloon\n",
    "in. A better strategy is to wait and see which hole the ball falls\n",
    "towards. You can then place it in that hole using less energy than in\n",
    "deterministic mode. Sometimes, the ball even falls into the hole on its\n",
    "own, and you don’t have to expend any energy, but it requires some skill\n",
    "to judge when you need to intervene. For this system Bert Kappen has\n",
    "shown mathematically that the best solution is to wait until the ball is\n",
    "close to the hole before you push it in. In other words, you should be\n",
    "deadline driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it seems here uncertainty is a good thing, because on average\n",
    "you’ll get the ball into the hole with less energy (by playing\n",
    "intelligently, and being deadline driven!) than you do with\n",
    "\\`deterministic mode’. It requires some skill to do this, more than the\n",
    "deterministic system, but by using your resources intelligently you can\n",
    "get more out of the system. However, if the uncertainty increases too\n",
    "much then regardless of your skill, you can’t control the ball at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple game explains many of the behaviours we exhibit in real\n",
    "life. If a system is completely deterministic, then we can make a\n",
    "decision early on and be sure that the ball will ‘drop in the hole’.\n",
    "However, if there is uncertainty in a system, it can make sense to delay\n",
    "our decision making until we’ve seen how events ‘pan out’. Be careful\n",
    "though, as we also see that when the uncertainty is large, if you don’t\n",
