title: "Simulating Contact Tracing in the Pandemic: TTI Explorer"
abstract: >
  COVID-19 pandemic has become the major influence on life of billions
  of people. To control the spread of the disease countries are trying
  various measures, and Testing, Tracing and Isolation (TTI) is one of
  them. In this talk we are going to discuss TTI Explorer, an open
  source simulation developed by Royal Society DELVE initiative in
  order to estimate effectiveness and resource requirements of TTI
  deployment in the UK. We will explain why TTI Explorer was
  developed, how does it work and what questions it was able to
  answer. In the final part of the talk we will build a couple of
  bridges back to the course, by discussing the sensitivity analysis
  of existing results, and by suggesting a few potential project
  ideas.
