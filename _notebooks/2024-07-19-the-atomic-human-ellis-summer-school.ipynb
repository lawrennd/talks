    "The record reads almost in note form, so it might be worth a quick\n",
    "review of what we think happened. Nergal-aha-iddina[1] was the original\n",

    "The case described in the tablet is unusual for two reasons. First, the\n",
    "shakannakku was normally a royal proxy but in this case we are told it\n",
    "was the King of Babylon himself, Adad-šuma-usur.[4] Second, the\n",
    "judgement is for a trial by water ordeal. Someone is going to be thrown\n",

    "The tablet contains words, but its interpretation requires knowledge.\n",

    "databases, his own expert knowledge and also his sense of what it means\n",
    "to be a human. The suspicion is that Sin-bununi may have sold the ox\n",
    "because his explanation of events – that the ox died and the servant,\n",
    "Siyatu, came, took the body and fed it to a dog – feels like a version\n",
    "of the modern ‘dog ate my homework’ excuse. The case hinges on an\n",
    "accusation, but it’s one person’s word against another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This judgement was passed over 3,200 years ago but, like a modern case,\n",
    "making it would have involved listening to witness statements and then\n",
    "coming to a decision. The choice of trial by ordeal implies that the\n",
