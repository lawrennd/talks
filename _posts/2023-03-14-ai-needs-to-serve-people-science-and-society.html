<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-today-is-ubiquitous">Artificial
intelligence today is ubiquitous</h2>
<p>It is deployed in health to map the consequences of genetic variation
in cancer. It is helping researchers find new <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/443/2/1651/1058949">pulsars</a>
and <a
href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41471-21/aa41471-21.html%20">planets</a>
It is providing faster approaches for <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895">solving complex equations</a> to
support climate science.</p>
<p>Cambridge has already made important contributions across these
fields. Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman revolutionised the
field of genomics with their <a
href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/journeysofdiscovery-rapidgenomesequencing">rapid
sequencing technology</a>. Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Tony Hewish
discovered a new class of astronomical object when they <a
href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/journeysofdiscovery-pulsars">observed
the first pulsar</a>. Maurice Wilkes and David Wheeler showed the power
of technology for problem solving, being the first to <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3001780?seq=1">solve a differential
equation with a digital computer</a>. These advances in science and
technology created new understandings of the world, and in turn provided
new tools that pushed forward the frontiers of science.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of AI sets it apart from other areas of technology
innovation, such as nanotechnologies, graphene, or fusion. AI is both a
rapidly-advancing research domain and an accelerator of innovation in
other disciplines and industry sectors.</p>
<h4
id="it-is-also-a-technology-that-is-intertwined-with-diverse-societal-interests.-its-impact-is-felt-across-society.">It
is also a technology that is intertwined with diverse societal
interests. <strong>Its impact is felt across society.</strong></h4>
<h1 id="ai-a-global-panacea">AI: a global panacea?</h1>
<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09926%20">is not simple</a>. Moreover,
a growing body of evidence shows that risks and benefits from AI
innovations are unevenly distributed across society.</p>
<h4
id="when-carelessly-deployed-ai-risks-exacerbating-existing-social-and-economic-inequalities.">When
carelessly deployed, <strong>AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities</strong>.</h4>
<p>Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology
design.</p>
<p>Building this pipeline will take coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.</p>
<h1 id="making-ai-equitable">Making AI equitable</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/ai">AI@Cam</a> is a new flagship
University mission that seeks to address these challenges. It recognises
that development of safe and effective AI-enabled innovations requires
this mix of expertise from across research domains, businesses,
policy-makers, civill society, and from affected communities. AI@Cam is
setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science,
citizens and society.</p>
<p>This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s
vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form
partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected
communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new
platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver
innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students,
researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between
the University and national AI priorities.</p>
<p>The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation
and steward of those innovations.</p>

is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and
practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to <strong>deliver
societal benefit and mitigate social harm</strong>.</h4>
<p>In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of
Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and
maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research
ecosystem.</p>

review</a>, published today, signals the University’s commitment to this
new wave of AI-enabled research and innovation. We look forward to
playing an active role in sharing the benefits of that technology across
society.</p>
