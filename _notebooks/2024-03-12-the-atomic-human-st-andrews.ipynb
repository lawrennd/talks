    "This is 20 years before the first academic department of applied\n",

    "\n",
    "The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was also credited to Benjamin\n",

    "1881 and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important breakthrough in\n",
    "overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with the\n",
    "formalization of the field through the development of *mathematical\n",
    "statistics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver little,\n",

    "Balfour and Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th century,\n",
    "numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences were being\n",
    "developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the purposes\n",
    "of government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same sense\n",
    "of frustration that Balfour experienced, the early promise of big data\n",
    "as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me, personally,\n",
    "peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting collaboration on a\n",
    "project to deploy “*Big Data* and *Internet of Things* in an *Industry\n",
    "4.0* environment”. Further questioning revealed that the actual project\n",
    "was optimization of the efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a\n",
    "far more tangible and *realizable* goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When\n",
    "dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo\n",
    "that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges\n",
    "can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype\n",
    "fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access\n",
    "we have to data. The way customers’ information is recorded and\n",

    "Sometimes this includes changing your conception of what data is and how\n",
    "it can be obtained. From automated production lines to apps on employee\n",
    "smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential\n",
    "data, personal data. For increasing awareness an internal audit can\n",
    "help. The website [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) hosts data made\n",
    "available by the UK government. To create this website the government’s\n",

    "this type of audit could be useful for understanding their internal\n",
    "digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign is a\n",
    "good map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?\n",
    "How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with\n",
    "unreliable data and *unreliable statistics*. The misrepresentations this\n",
    "leads to are worse than the absence of data as they give a false sense\n",

    "pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its value, one that\n",
    "needs to permeate the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary\n",

    "interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is\n",
    "providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made\n",
    "more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by\n",
    "individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the\n",

    "[Bert Kappen](https://www.snn.ru.nl/~bertk/). The game is as follows:\n",
    "you need to place a falling balloon into one of two holes, but if the\n",
    "balloon misses the holes it will pop on pins placed in the ground. In\n",
    "‘deterministic mode’, the balloon falls straight towards the ground and\n",
    "the game is easy. You simply choose which hole to place the ball in, and\n",
    "you can start to place it there as soon as the ball appears at the top\n",
    "of the screen. The game becomes more interesting as you increase the\n",

    "balloon being blown left and right as it falls. This movement means that\n",
    "it is not sensible to decide early on which hole to place the balloon\n",
    "in. A better strategy is to wait and see which hole the ball falls\n",
    "towards. You can then place it in that hole using less energy than in\n",
    "deterministic mode. Sometimes, the ball even falls into the hole on its\n",
    "own, and you don’t have to expend any energy, but it requires some skill\n",
    "to judge when you need to intervene. For this system Bert Kappen has\n",
    "shown mathematically that the best solution is to wait until the ball is\n",
    "close to the hole before you push it in. In other words, you should be\n",
    "deadline driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it seems here uncertainty is a good thing, because on average\n",
