title: Deep Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  In this talk we describe how deep neural networks can be modified to
  produce deep Gaussian process models. The framework of deep Gaussian
  processes allow for unsupervised learning, transfer learning,
  semi-supervised learning, multi-task learning and principled handling of
  different data types (count data, binary data, heavy tailed noise
  distributions). The main challenge is to handle the intractabilities. In
  this talk we review the variational bounds that are used under the
  framework of variational compression and give some initial results of
  deep Gaussian process models.
