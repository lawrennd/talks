title: "Computer Vision Reading Group: The Gaussian Process Latent Variable
  Model"
venue: Computer Vision Reading Group, Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, U.K.
abstract: |
  The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) is a recently
  proposed probabilistic approach to obtaining a reduced dimension
  representation of a data set. In this tutorial we motivate and
  describe the GP-LVM, giving a review of the model itself and some of
  the concepts behind it.
