title: "Law and the Atomic Human"
abstract: |
  A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re having
  about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our identity?

  Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
  intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI
  not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the
  implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our
  position at the centre of the world.

  Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
  continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components:
  eventually we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek
  for uncuttable is ‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the
  facets of human intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI
  uncovers what is left: an indivisible core that is the essence of
  humanity.

  I’ll contrast our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence and speculate on what
  it means for our future with a particular focus on the legal profession.

  This talk is based on Neil’s forthcoming book to be published with
  Allen Lane in June 2024.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\notes{The atomic human emerges from limitations and vulnerabilities. It is that shared experience that gives individual humans and their institutions the authority to make consequential decisions about other humans that may effect their financial status, their reputation, their health, education or their liberty.}

\notes{A challenge we face is that of the "sorcerer's apprentice" where companies have deployed capabilities that they can't control and that have compromised the nature of the open society.}

\notes{As future professionals you will need to be able to wield these capabilities and understand their weaknesses to fulfill your role in society.}

\slides{* The Atomic Human emerges from limitations and vulnerabilities.
* Consequential decisions need human judgment. 
* There's a danger of disempowerment of professionals and dereliction of responsibilities.
  * E.g. as in the "trial by ordeal" of Siyatu compare with Horizon.
* Future of professions depends on developing and deploying these technologies in a way that empowers individuals.
