    "In this note book we deal with reviewer calibration. Our assumption is\n",

    "y_{i,j} = f_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{i, j}\n",
    "$$ where $f_i$ is the ‘objective quality’ of paper $i$ and $b_j$ is an\n",
    "offset associated with reviewer $j$. $\\epsilon_{i,j}$ is a subjective\n",
    "quality estimate which reflects how a specific reviewer’s opinion\n",
    "differs from other reviewers (such differences in opinion may be due to\n",
    "differing expertise or perspective). The underlying ‘objective quality’\n",
    "of the paper is assumed to be the same for all reviewers and the\n",
    "reviewer offset is assumed to be the same for all papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have $n$ papers and $m$ reviewers, then this implies $n$ + $m$ +\n",
    "$nm$ values need to be estimated. Naturally this is too many, and we can\n",
    "start by assuming that the subjective quality is drawn from a normal\n",
    "density with variance $\\sigma^2$ $$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{i, j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\n",
    "$$ which reduces us to $n$ + $m$ + 1 parameters. Further we can assume\n",
    "that the objective quality is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu$\n",
    "and variance $\\alpha_f$, $$\n",
    "f_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\alpha_f)\n",
    "$$ this now reduces us to $m$+3 parameters. However, we only have\n",
    "approximately $4m$ observations (4 papers per reviewer) so parameters\n",
    "may still not be that well determined (particularly for those reviewers\n",

    "$$ which we rewrite to give two ratios: offset/signal ratio,\n",

    "$$ The advantage of this parameterization is it allows us to optimize\n",
    "$\\alpha_f$ directly (with a fixed-point equation) and it will be very\n",
    "well determined. This leaves us with two free parameters, that we can\n",
    "explore on the grid. It is in these parameters that we expect the\n",
    "remaining underdetermindness of the model. We expect $\\alpha_f$ to be\n",

    "\\frac{|\\mathbf{y}|}{2}\\log\\alpha_f + \\frac{1}{2}\\log  \\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}\\right| + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha_f}\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y},\n",
    "$$ where $|\\mathbf{y}|$ is the length of $\\mathbf{y}$ (i.e. the number\n",
    "of reviews) and $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\alpha_f^{-1}\\mathbf{K}$ is the scale\n",
    "normalized covariance. This negative log likelihood is easily minimized\n",
    "to recover $$\n",
    "\\alpha_f = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{y}|} \\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}.\n",
    "$$ A Bayesian analysis of this parameter is possible with gamma priors,\n",

    "find $\\alpha_f$ and then evaluate the liklihood. Worst case this will\n",
    "require us inverting $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}$, but if the reviewer paper\n",
    "groups are disconnected, it can be done a lot quicker. Next stage is to\n",

    "Under the simple model we have outlined, we can be confident that there\n",
    "is inconsistency between two independent committees, but the level of\n",
    "inconsistency is much less than we would find for a random committee. If\n",
    "we accept that the bias introduced by the Area Chairs knowing when they\n",
    "were dealing with duplicates was minimal, then if we were to revisit the\n",
    "NIPS 2014 conference with an independent committee then we would expect\n",
    "between **38% and 64% of the presented papers to be the same**. If the\n",
    "conference was run at random, then we would only expect 25% of the\n",
    "papers to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s apparent from comments and speculation about what these results\n",
    "mean, that some people might be surprised by the size of this figure.\n",
    "However, it only requires a little thought to see that this figure is\n",
    "likely to be large for any highly selective conference if there is even\n",
    "a small amount of inconsistency in the decision-making process. This is\n",
    "because once the conference has chosen to be ‘highly selective’ then\n",
    "because, by definition, only a small percentage of papers are to be\n",
    "accepted. Now if we think of a type I error as accepting a paper which\n",
    "should be rejected, such errors are easier to make because, again by\n",
    "definition, many more papers should be rejected. Type II errors\n",
    "(rejecting a paper that should be accepted) are less likely because (by\n",
    "setting the accept rate low) there are fewer papers that should be\n",
    "accepted in the first place. When there is a difference of opinion\n",
    "between reviewers, it does seem that many of the aruguments can be\n",
    "distilled down to (a subjective opinion) about whether controlling for\n",
    "type I or type II errors is more important. Further, normally when\n",
    "discussing type I and type II errors we believe that the underlying\n",
    "system of study is genuinely binary: e.g., diseased or not diseased.\n",
    "However, for conferences the accept/reject boundary is not a clear\n",
    "separation point, there is a continuum (or spectrum) of paper quality\n",
    "(as there also is for some diseases). And the decision boundary often\n",
    "falls in a region of very high density.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would prefer a world were a conference is no longer viewed as a proxy\n",
    "for research quality. The true test of quality is time. In the current\n",
    "world, papers from conferences such as NeurIPS are being used to judge\n",
    "whether a researcher is worthy of a position at a leading company, or\n",
    "whether a researcher gets tenure. This is problematic and damaging for\n",
    "the community. Reviewing is an inconsistent process, but that is not a\n",
    "bad thing. It is far worse to have a reviewing system that is\n",
    "consistently wrong than one which is inconsistently wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "My own view of a NeurIPS paper is inspired by the Millenium Galleries in\n",
    "Sheffield. There, among the exhibitions they sometimes have work done by\n",
    "apprentices in their ‘qualification’. Sheffield is known for knives, and\n",
    "the work of the apprentices in making knives is sometimes very intricate\n",
    "indeed. But it does lead to some very impractical knives. NeurIPS seems\n",
    "to be good at judging technical skill, but not impact. And I suspect the\n",
    "same is true of many other meetings. So, a publication a NeurIPS does\n",
    "seem to indicate that the author has some of the skills required, but it\n",
    "does not necessarily imply that the paper will be impactful."
