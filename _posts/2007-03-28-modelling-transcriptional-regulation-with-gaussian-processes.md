title: Modelling Transcriptional Regulation with Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  Modelling the dynamics of transcriptional processes in the cell requires
  the knowledge of a number of key biological quantities. While some of
  them are relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates and mRNA
  abundance levels, it is still very hard to measure the active
  concentration levels of the transcription factor proteins that drive the
  process and the sensitivity of target genes to these concentrations. In
  this paper we show how these quantities for a given transcription factor
  can be inferred from gene expression levels of a set of known target
  genes. We treat the protein concentration as a latent function with a
  Gaussian process prior, and include the sensitivities, mRNA decay rates
  and baseline expression levels as hyperparameters. We apply this
  procedure to a human leukemia dataset, focusing on the tumour repressor
  p53 and obtaining results in good accordance with recent biological
  studies.
