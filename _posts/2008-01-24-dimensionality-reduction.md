title: Dimensionality Reduction
abstract: We approach dimensionality reduction from the perspective of multidimensional
  scaling. Starting from the basics, we draw the relationship between multidimensional
  scaling and principal component analysis. From this background we briefly review
  kernel PCA and Isomap. Finally, we consider the problem of model selection using
  Gaussian processes.
