AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.\n",

    "This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.\n",

    "Let’s take a step back from artificial intelligence, and consider\n",
    "natural intelligence. Or even more generally, let’s consider the\n",
    "contrast between an artificial *system* and an natural system. The key\n",
    "difference between the two is that artificial systems are *designed*\n",
    "whereas natural systems are *evolved*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems design is a major component of all Engineering disciplines. The\n",
    "details differ, but there is a single common theme: achieve your\n",
    "objective with the minimal use of resources to do the job. That provides\n",
    "efficiency. The engineering designer imagines a solution that requires\n",
    "the minimal set of components to achieve the result. A water pump has\n",
    "one route through the pump. That minimises the number of components\n",
    "needed. Redundancy is introduced only in safety critical systems, such\n",
    "as aircraft control systems. Students of biology, however, will be aware\n",
    "that in nature system-redundancy is everywhere. Redundancy leads to\n",
    "robustness. For an organism to survive in an evolving environment it\n",
    "must first be robust, then it can consider how to be efficient. Indeed,\n",
    "organisms that evolve to be too efficient at a particular task, like\n",
    "those that occupy a niche environment, are particularly vulnerable to\n",
    "extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion is akin to the idea that only the best will survive,\n",
    "popularly encoded into an notion of evolution by Herbert Spencer’s\n",
    "quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Survival of the fittest\n",
    ">\n",
    "> [Herbet Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer), 1864\n",

    "Darwin himself never said “Survival of the Fittest” he talked about\n",
    "evolution by natural selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Non-survival of the non-fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution is better described as “non-survival of the non-fit”. You\n",
    "don’t have to be the fittest to survive, you just need to avoid the\n",
    "pitfalls of life. This is the first priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is with natural vs artificial intelligences. Any natural\n",
    "intelligence that was not robust to changes in its external environment\n",
    "would not survive, and therefore not reproduce. In contrast the\n",
    "artificial intelligences we produce are designed to be efficient at one\n",
    "specific task: control, computation, playing chess. They are *fragile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule of a natural system is not be intelligent, it is “don’t\n",
    "be stupid”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mistake we make in the design of our systems is to equate fitness with\n",
    "the objective function, and to assume it is known and static. In\n",
    "practice, a real environment would have an evolving fitness function\n",
    "which would be unknown at any given time.\n",

    "The first criterion of a natural intelligence is *don’t fail*, not\n",
    "because it has a will or intent of its own, but because if it had failed\n",
    "it wouldn’t have stood the test of time. It would no longer exist. In\n",
    "contrast, the mantra for artificial systems is to be more efficient. Our\n",
    "artificial systems are often given a single objective (in machine\n",

    "smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential\n",

    "\n",
    "Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?\n",
    "How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with\n",

    "providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made\n",

    "If you want to complete a task, should you do it now or should you put\n",
    "it off until tomorrow? Despite being told to not delay tasks, many of us\n",
    "are deadline driven. Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kappenball is a simple game that illustrates that this behaviour can be\n",
    "optimal. It is inspired by an example in stochastic optimal control by\n",
    "[Bert Kappen](https://www.snn.ru.nl/~bertk/). The game is as follows:\n",
    "you need to place a falling balloon into one of two holes, but if the\n",
    "balloon misses the holes it will pop on pins placed in the ground. In\n",
    "‘deterministic mode’, the balloon falls straight towards the ground and\n",
    "the game is easy. You simply choose which hole to place the ball in, and\n",
    "you can start to place it there as soon as the ball appears at the top\n",
    "of the screen. The game becomes more interesting as you increase the\n",
    "uncertainty. In Kappenball, the uncertainty takes the form of the\n",
    "balloon being blown left and right as it falls. This movement means that\n",
    "it is not sensible to decide early on which hole to place the balloon\n",
    "in. A better strategy is to wait and see which hole the ball falls\n",
    "towards. You can then place it in that hole using less energy than in\n",
    "deterministic mode. Sometimes, the ball even falls into the hole on its\n",
    "own, and you don’t have to expend any energy, but it requires some skill\n",
    "to judge when you need to intervene. For this system Bert Kappen has\n",
    "shown mathematically that the best solution is to wait until the ball is\n",
    "close to the hole before you push it in. In other words, you should be\n",
    "deadline driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it seems here uncertainty is a good thing, because on average\n",
    "you’ll get the ball into the hole with less energy (by playing\n",
    "intelligently, and being deadline driven!) than you do with\n",
    "\\`deterministic mode’. It requires some skill to do this, more than the\n",
    "deterministic system, but by using your resources intelligently you can\n",
    "get more out of the system. However, if the uncertainty increases too\n",
    "much then regardless of your skill, you can’t control the ball at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple game explains many of the behaviours we exhibit in real\n",
    "life. If a system is completely deterministic, then we can make a\n",
    "decision early on and be sure that the ball will ‘drop in the hole’.\n",
    "However, if there is uncertainty in a system, it can make sense to delay\n",
    "our decision making until we’ve seen how events ‘pan out’. Be careful\n",
    "though, as we also see that when the uncertainty is large, if you don’t\n",
    "have the resources or the skill to be deadline-driven the uncertainty\n",
    "can overwhelm you and events can quickly move beyond our control."
